      " Unregistered villas, flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation  across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers, homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures.  These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists, too, prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1,000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections.  With business being encroached, occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital.  The tourism department says there are around 3,350 registered hotels and 1,656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says , “Due to these unregistered accommodations, tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels, bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.” “The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations, which causes losses to the government also,” he said.  Hoteliers claim that it has become difficult for them to meet fixed expenditures such as staff salaries, electricity bills, water bills and garbage-collection fee.  The industry is already reeling in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. Apart from a six-month waiver on fixed demand charges levied on hotels by Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited no other financial help has been extended to the hotel industry. The government has also announced an interest subvention scheme for the hotel industry, under which working capital will be provided to hotels but this has proved to be an eye wash as none of the hotelier benefitted from the scheme  due to stringent norms. Banks are reluctant to sanction loans to hoteliers under the scheme.Rebate in property tax and waiver of garbage fee for the period when the hotels were completely closed is still awaited.  Travel agents out of job Travel Chapter Anil Bhardwaj senior vice-president said travel agents were not getting any business. “Unless  Volvo bus service and flights are not resumed and train connectivity from Bengal, Maharashtra ,Delhi and Gujarat is not streamlined. Travel agents cannot expect any business. Moreover, online travel companies are also eating into travel agents’ business.”  “The government should restart Volvos and ask the railways to restore of all train routes up to Kalka and Chandigarh at the earliest to save the travel and tourism industry,” he said. Hoteliers and tourism stakeholders do not expect the tourism and hospitality sectors to normalise before the summer and are seeking financial aid from the government. They have demanded that the  government announce a special package, which includes domestic tariff for water, garbage-collection fee, property tax, waiver of fixed demand charges on electricity bills for at least one year and unconditional and collateral-free financial assistance in the shape of working capital loan to all hotels through state cooperative banks.  \n",

      " Unregistered villas, flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation  across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers, homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures.  These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists, too, prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1,000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections.  With business being encroached, occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital.  The tourism department says there are around 3,350 registered hotels and 1,656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says , “Due to these unregistered accommodations, tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels, bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.” “The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations, which causes losses to the government also,” he said.  Hoteliers claim that it has become difficult for them to meet fixed expenditures such as staff salaries, electricity bills, water bills and garbage-collection fee.  The industry is already reeling in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. Apart from a six-month waiver on fixed demand charges levied on hotels by Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited no other financial help has been extended to the hotel industry. The government has also announced an interest subvention scheme for the hotel industry, under which working capital will be provided to hotels but this has proved to be an eye wash as none of the hotelier benefitted from the scheme  due to stringent norms. Banks are reluctant to sanction loans to hoteliers under the scheme.Rebate in property tax and waiver of garbage fee for the period when the hotels were completely closed is still awaited.  Travel agents out of job Travel Chapter Anil Bhardwaj senior vice-president said travel agents were not getting any business. “Unless  Volvo bus service and flights are not resumed and train connectivity from Bengal, Maharashtra ,Delhi and Gujarat is not streamlined. Travel agents cannot expect any business. Moreover, online travel companies are also eating into travel agents’ business.”  “The government should restart Volvos and ask the railways to restore of all train routes up to Kalka and Chandigarh at the earliest to save the travel and tourism industry,” he said. Hoteliers and tourism stakeholders do not expect the tourism and hospitality sectors to normalise before the summer and are seeking financial aid from the government. They have demanded that the  government announce a special package, which includes domestic tariff for water, garbage-collection fee, property tax, waiver of fixed demand charges on electricity bills for at least one year and unconditional and collateral-free financial assistance in the shape of working capital loan to all hotels through state cooperative banks.  \n",

      " Unregistered villas, flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation  across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers, homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures.  These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists, too, prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1,000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections.  With business being encroached, occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital.  The tourism department says there are around 3,350 registered hotels and 1,656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says , “Due to these unregistered accommodations, tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels, bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.” “The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations, which causes losses to the government also,” he said.

      " Unregistered villas, flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation  across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers, homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures.  These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists, too, prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1,000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections.  With business being encroached, occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital.  The tourism department says there are around 3,350 registered hotels and 1,656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says , “Due to these unregistered accommodations, tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels, bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.” “The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations, which causes losses to the government also,” he said.  Hoteliers claim that it has become difficult for them to meet fixed expenditures such as staff salaries, electricity bills, water bills and garbage-collection fee.  The industry is already reeling in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. Apart from a six-month waiver on fixed demand charges levied on hotels by Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited no other financial help has been extended to the hotel industry. The government has also announced an interest subvention scheme for the hotel industry, under which working capital will be provided to hotels but this has proved to be an eye wash as none of the hotelier benefitted from the scheme  due to stringent norms. Banks are reluctant to sanction loans to hoteliers under the scheme.Rebate in property tax and waiver of garbage fee for the period when the hotels were completely closed is still awaited.  Travel agents out of job Travel Chapter Anil Bhardwaj senior vice-president said travel agents were not getting any business. “Unless  Volvo bus service and flights are not resumed and train connectivity from Bengal, Maharashtra ,Delhi and Gujarat is not streamlined. Travel agents cannot expect any business. Moreover, online travel companies are also eating into travel agents’ business.”  “The government should restart Volvos and ask the railways to restore of all train routes up to Kalka and Chandigarh at the earliest to save the travel and tourism industry,” he said. Hoteliers and tourism stakeholders do not expect the tourism and hospitality sectors to normalise before the summer and are seeking financial aid from the government. They have demanded that the  government announce a special package, which includes domestic tariff for water, garbage-collection fee, property tax, waiver of fixed demand charges on electricity bills for at least one year and unconditional and collateral-free financial assistance in the shape of working capital loan to all hotels through state cooperative banks.  \n",

      " Unregistered villas, flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation  across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers, homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures.  These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists, too, prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1,000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections.  With business being encroached, occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital.  The tourism department says there are around 3,350 registered hotels and 1,656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says , “Due to these unregistered accommodations, tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels, bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.” “The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations, which causes losses to the government also,” he said.  Hoteliers claim that it has become difficult for them to meet fixed expenditures such as staff salaries, electricity bills, water bills and garbage-collection fee.

      "Bollywood film producer Firoz Nadiadwala’s wife was arrested on Sunday by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) after 10 grams of marijuana was found at their home in Mumbai during raids, said officials. Three more people were arrested in raids and are suspected to be drug peddlers and suppliers.  In the operation, the NCB seized a total drug of 727.1 gram of Ganja, 74.1 gram charas and 95.1 gram MD (Commercial Quantity) along with cash Rs. 3,58,610 cash from the peddlers and suppliers. Zonal director Sameer Wankhede of the NCB confirmed the arrest of Shabana Saeed, wife of Firoz Nadiadwala.  “The operation is still going on hence the names of the other three suppliers cannot be revealed at this stage. We have seized commercial quantities of drugs from their possession in the entire operation” said Wankhede.  Following a tip-off, the NCB first arrested Andheri resident Wahid Abdul Kadir Shaikh alias Sultan Mirza from Andheri (west). During interrogation he revealed the name of Saeed whom he had supplied marijuana. Shaikh is in the drug supply from several years and is known as Sultan Mirza in the drug supply chain, said NCB officials.

The search was conducted in presence of two independent witnesses and 10 gram of marijuana was recovered which was procured from Shaikh. The notice was issued under section 67 of the NDPS act and she was arrested after recording her statement, said an NCB official. Apart from Saeed and Shaikh, the NCB arrested three more drug suppliers in the operation and their questioning is underway to get more information. Firoz Nadiadwala has produced several Bollywood films like Welcome, Phir Hera Pheri, Aarakshan, Deewane Huye Pagal, Kartoosh, among others. \n",

As bursting of firecrackers cause respiratory-related problem, it also generate aerosols which may transmit Covid virus more rapidly. Some states have already taken a decision to ban firecrackers during Diwali. Hence, citizens on their own need to take necessary care and avoid firecrackers this seson.”  The mayor said that as the Mumbai municipal corporation has taken some decisions regarding firecrackers, the Pune counterpart has sought the details and could issue guidelines likewise.  “I request traders and kids who burst crackers during the festival, mainly on Laxmi Puja, to keep it at a minimum level as it will badly affect those with respiratory issues,” he said.  A civic official on condition of anonymity said, “With many restrictions already in place due to the Covid situation, we have only made a public appeal to avoid use of crackers instead of banning it. As it is, there is no mechanism to check citizens using firecrackers during the festival.”  Meanwhile, the civic administration has already put in place many checks and guidelines for crackers sellers to put up roadside stalls in an effort to bring down supply numbers.  NCP demands ban on cracker sale  Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) spokesperson Ankush Kakade has demanded the state ban on sale of firecrackers in view of the Covid situation. Kakade has written to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to take the decision as carried out by Delhi and other states.  \n",
