"India is reporting less severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases  said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan during the 19th group of ministers’ (GoM) meeting held on Friday  as only 0.28% of patients are being currently on ventilator support across the country.  “Out of the total active cases  only 0.28% of patients are on ventilator support  1.61% patients on intensive care unit (ICU) support  and 2.32% are on oxygen support ” the minister said.  India’s case recovery rate is also improving steadily  and with over one million recoveries the current national recovery rate is 64.54%  he cited.  Delhi has recorded the highest recovery rate at 89.08%  followed by Haryana (79.82%). Karnataka has the lowest recovery rate at 39.36%.  “…this shows that the active cases under medical supervision are 33.27%  or approximately one-third of total Covid-19 positive cases. India’s case fatality rate (CFR) is also progressively reducing and currently stands at 2.18%  one of the lowest globally ” said the health minister.  The government aims to reduce the CFR further and bring down the national average to 1% or below.  The government is laying emphasis on reducing mortality in high-case load districts/ cities  and cities showing recent upsurge such as Pune  Thane  Bengaluru  and Hyderabad  etc.  The GoM also reviewed the distribution of confirmed Covid-19 cases along with locality and active cases in the containment zones across rural and urban India.  It has been found that the maximum caseload  which was about 80% of the cases  is restricted to 50 out of about 740 districts in the country.  In moderate caseload districts/cities  the efforts are on to focus on preventing spill-over from the high-burden areas; limiting local spread; early identification of cases; strengthening contact tracing with the use of technology; and community involvement.  In low-burden districts  the efforts are aimed at preventing infection among the population from other areas; strengthening influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance and targeted testing; rigorous contact tracing with targets to be set by the local administration such as 15-20 contacts for every Covid-19 patient and prior identification of the high-risk population.  “This three-pronged strategy will help in controlling the disease spread. However  our main concern should be protecting the areas  where no Covid-19 cases are being reported  and also ensuring there is no increase in caseload in low disease-burden areas. The key is to strengthen community engagement  as it will help in sending the message across effectively ” said Jugal Kishore  head  community medicine  Safdarjung Hospital.  On the rapidly expanding testing capacity of India  Harsh Vardhan highlighted that to date  through a network of 1 331 laboratories  including 911 and 420 government-run and private ones  respectively  a record 6 42 588 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours.  The country has carried out over 10.8 million tests since the viral outbreak was first reported.  “The more you test  the better it will in controlling the disease transmission  as you would be picking up cases early who would otherwise be roaming within the community and exposing the vulnerable population to the virus ” says Dr. T Jacob John  former head  virology department  Christian Medical College  Vellore  Tamil Nadu.  The domestic production capacities of various sectors involved in Covid-19 management such as for manufacturing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits  masks  ventilators  and drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have also been ramped up over the past three months.  In terms of healthcare logistics  cumulatively 268.25 lakh N-95 masks  120.40 lakh PPEs  and 1083.77 lakh HCQ tablets have been distributed to all states and Central institutions.  ",delhi,ht
"India’s coronavirus lockdown made little difference to Bollywood superstars but for the industry’s vast army of low-paid  unskilled workers it meant unemployment  hunger and homelessness -- with no end in sight even as shoots gradually resume. Fahim Shaikh used to earn 800 rupees ($11) a day as a “spot boy” on sets  doing odd jobs such as making tea. When Bollywood hit pause on productions in March  the 23-year-old could no longer pay rent. “I just wandered up and down  asking strangers for help and sleeping outside cafes ” he told AFP. Like many starry-eyed newcomers  he came to Mumbai in pursuit of an acting career before his dreams gave way to the pressures of the daily grind in India’s most expensive city. The hugely successful Hindi film industry is tentatively coming back to life but with strict rules including curbs on the number of people allowed on set. This means that jobs for people like Shaikh are now few and far between. “I am ready to do anything  I desperately need work ” he said. - ‘The littlest players’ - The lockdown cast a spotlight on India’s extreme inequality with well-heeled citizens able to hibernate safely at home while watching shocking scenes of a huge migrant worker exodus play out on their television and smartphone screens. That chasm between the haves and have-nots is perhaps even more pronounced in Bollywood  where jet-setting megastars rub shoulders with tens of thousands of extras  spot boys and other junior crew members who exist on the margins of the glamorous industry. “The spot boys are considered the littlest players  till food arrives late on a set ” actress Richa Chadha wrote on her blog highlighting the “disastrous” effects of the lockdown. During her half-century-long stint as an extra  Sayeda Mumani has worked alongside virtually every major actor  from 1970s matinee idol Rajesh Khanna to superstar Shah Rukh Khan. In a good month  the 68-year-old scraped together around 14 000 rupees. But her income dried up after shoots came to a standstill  and she has not worked for months. Unlike the younger Shaikh -- who has few industry contacts -- Mumani’s long association with leading studios meant that she could count on at least a little help  with top actors such as Amitabh Bachchan and Salman Khan sending her grocery vouchers and cash. But relying on the piecemeal generosity of individuals has severe limitations  as Mumani found out  when mounting medical and household expenses left her with a debt of 100 000 rupees. “I feel so useless and helpless ” she told AFP. - No safety net - Despite generating billions of dollars in revenue  the world’s most prolific film industry has no established scheme to protect its most vulnerable members. The vast majority of the tens of thousands of industry workers lack access to medical insurance or pension plans. Director Anubhav Sinha  who paid salaries to his production staff and offered financial aid to other crew members during the lockdown  said the absence of a safety net reflected the fact that the industry’s workforce is largely freelance. “My employees... comprise about 10 percent of the entire size of my film unit. Ninety percent are freelancers who work on the production and then move on ” he told AFP. And although the industry is home to multiple unions  they lack the deep pockets to look after their members  said Amit Behl  senior joint secretary of the Cine & TV Artists Association. The organisation  which has more than 9 000 members including top stars  had to request donations to support actors who “are virtually living hand to mouth”  Behl told AFP. “We produce twice the content of other filmmaking countries but we are not structured ” he said. Furthermore  he warned that fresh restrictions  which include a ban on filming crowd scenes  hiring large crews or actors over 65  meant that the crisis was set to worsen  leaving workers like Mumani fearing for their future. “We can’t carry on like this ” she said  bursting into tears. “I feel like I am dying already.” (This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

"Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal on Friday rejected the AAP government’s decision to allow the reopening of hotels in the city. The decision to reopen hotels  allowed under the MHA guidelines of July 31  was taken on Thursday. However  a formal order was not released. Within 24 hours  Baijal struck down the move  along with the decision to allow weekly bazaars to reopen. Officials in Baijal’s office confirmed the development. However  a formal statement from the L-G office is still awaited. Last month  Baijal  in his capacity as the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA)  had also overturned the Delhi government’s decisions to limit the scope of testing and reserve hospital beds in state government-run and private facilities only for bonafide residents of the city. After the government issued a brief statement on reopening hotels on Thursday  the hospitality industry had welcomed the move  while pointing out that certain challenges involved in unlocking ranging from staff crunch to renewal of fire safety licenses will have to be ironed out. The government had said that since hotels are no longer attached to hospitals  a decision has been taken to allow their normal functioning along with their hospitality services. According to government estimates  there are around 55 five-star hotels in Delhi  120 four-star facilities  and around 1800 three-star hotels. There are also over 1500 budget hotels in the city.

"The Supreme Court Friday directed that no BS-IV vehicles will be registered with the authorities till it decides the issue of sale of such vehicles during the lockdown period. The top court was earlier irked over the violation of its order and had pulled up the automobile dealers association by saying that the BS-IV vehicles were sold during the lockdown in last week of March and after March 31 also. The bench had on July 8 recalled the March 27 order by which it had allowed sale of BS-IV vehicles for 10 days across India  except in Delhi-NCR  after lifting of the COVID-19 lockdown. The relief  which was later withdrawn  to permit sale of the BS-IV vehicles for a small window period after lifting of the lockdown was granted to the dealers by the apex court keeping in mind the fact that the country had decided to not to allow their sale after March 2020.
During the brief hearing conducted through video conferencing on Friday  a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra made clear that no BS-4 vehicles will be registered by the authorities till it decides the issue. The bench  also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murari  asked the automobile dealers association to place before it the details of vehicles sold either online or through direct sale during the lockdown period in last week of March. The bench said it needed to verify the details regarding sale and registration of BS-4 vehicles in lockdown period. “You are in great trouble. We will prosecute somebody ” the bench told the counsel appearing for the dealers association. “We will take appropriate action against these fellows ” the bench said while referring to the surge in the number of vehicles sold especially on March 29  30 and 31. The bench has now posted the matter for further hearing on August 13. The top court had on July 24 expressed displeasure over an oral plea by the automobile dealers association that dealers should be allowed to return unsold inventory of BS-IV vehicles to the manufacturers so that they could be exported to other countries. The association had said that there are some countries where sale of BS-IV compliant vehicles were still allowed. However  the bench had observed “Why should we pass orders for that? Manufacturers were aware of the deadline.” ",delhi,ie

"A DAY after the Centre issued guidelines for phase 3 of its Covid unlockdown  the Delhi government Thursday allowed hotels to reopen in a move that was welcomed by the hospitality industry although concerns remain on the challenges involved  ranging from a severe staff crunch to the renewal of licences that have lapsed. The state government said that a decision has been taken to allow the normal functioning of hotels  along with hospitality services — these were already permitted under the Union Home Ministry’s guidelines issued on June 4. The government said that it took the step since hotels in Delhi are no longer attached with hospitals to provide quarantine facilities for Covid patients. Unlock 3.0 guidelines|  Here is what’s allowed  what’s not However  official sources said that a decision on reopening gyms  which has been allowed under the Centre’s latest guidelines  has been deferred in the capital till next week amid concerns over the potential spread of Covid in closed spaces. “Officials will discuss the apprehensions and revisit the decision next week ” sources said. On the move to reopen hotels  Sandeep Khandelwal  president of the Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association  under which a chain of budget hotels operate  described the decision as a “beginning”. “It will take time for business to revive and we are not expecting much till the end of August. But it is a beginning nonetheless. There will be an intense staff crunch. However  the primary challenge will be in terms of renewing a number of licences that we require to operate  most importantly  fire licences that have not been renewed this entire season ” Khandelwal said. According to government estimates  there are about 55 five-star  120 four-star  1 800 three-star and 1500 budget hotels in the city. The managements of several hotels declined to comment on the government’s decision  citing the lack of an official order. However  executives involved in running many of these facilities agreed with Khandelwal that they are not expecting business till the end of August. The management of The Suryaa  a five-star hotel  said the decision was “welcome”  especially since no Covid patient was shifted to its premises despite the facility being attached with Holy Family Hospital. Greesh Bindra  vice-president (operations) of The Suryaa told The Indian Express: “The order on reopening is still awaited. However  for now  we can say it is a welcome step. The reopening involves a lot of challenges and won’t be at one go  but gradual. The private offices that operate out of the hotel premises can resume work  for one.” Asked about the staff crunch  a senior executive in the industry said many hotels would operate with a limited capacity. “Say  a hotel has 200 rooms  it will reopen with 50 rooms. Staff will also be called accordingly. The coffee shops and the restaurants will be opened. But business will not pick up unless bars and pubs are allowed. Banquet halls need to be allowed as well and that will make sense only after the cap on guests during marriages or social functions are done away with ” said the executive  who did not wish to be identified. In its June 4 SOP  the Centre had listed a series of “generic guidelines”  such as advising persons above 65 years of age  those with comorbidities  pregnant women and children below the age of 10 to stay at home. Apart from mandating the use of masks and sanitisers  and stressing on social distancing  the SOP had said that only asymptomatic staff and guests would be allowed in hotels. In its latest guidelines  the Centre said that schools and colleges  Metro rail services  cinema halls  swimming pools  entertainment parks  theatres  bars  auditoriums and assembly halls shall continue to remain shut until August 31. “Social/ political/ sports/ entertainment/ academic/ cultural/ religious functions and other large congregations” will also not be allowed  it said.

"The daily Covid-19 biomedical waste generation in Delhi increased by 15 times in June as compared to the previous month  and the city is presently producing more refuse than its common biomedical waste treatment facilities (CBWTF) can treat  data shared with the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (EPCA) shows.

On Wednesday  the apex court had pulled up the institute for backing out of the project to set up smog towers in Delhi in a bid to combat air pollution  and warned of contempt action against it. On Thursday  Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench  headed by Justice Arun Mishra  that “after yesterday’s hearing  we have been in contact with Indian Institute of Technology  Bombay  and an MoU will be signed electronically with the stakeholders”. The bench asked Mehta to place the MoU on record  and sought to know of the funds required for the project and the time needed for its completion. Mehta pointed out that the technical aspects would be covered by IIT-Bombay  and the parts from Minnesota  United States  had been imported. The bench reminded that its January 13 direction to set up a smog tower in Anand Vihar had a three-month deadline attached to it. “Why the order which directed compliance in three months was not complied with?” asked Justice Mishra. Mehta replied it would take at least 10 months to complete the project and said  “I will be happy if it is done within a week.” The court asked the Solicitor General to file a detailed affidavit touching on various aspects of execution of the project by August 3.

"Three men were arrested by Delhi Police’s Crime Branch Thursday for allegedly looting cash and jewellery from a Delhi University staffer’s house  while holding him and his 63-year-old mother hostage at gunpoint. The incident took place at Nehru Vihar on Monday. Police said the men  Md Chand (30)  Javed (31) and Salim  have no previous cases against them. Two of their associates are on the run. Police said Chand lost his job during the lockdown  while Javed was in debt as he spent money on his sister’s wedding.

"The price of diesel will come down by Rs 8.36 per litre in the capital with the Delhi government rolling back its decision — taken in May — to hike tax on the fuel. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the rate of VAT on diesel was being brought back to 16.75 per cent from 30 per cent. The decision was taken in a Cabinet meeting Thursday morning. “The price of diesel was Rs 82 per litre on Wednesday. After the reduction of VAT  the new price will be Rs 73.64 per litre ” Kejriwal said  describing the move as a significant step to bring the economy back on track. On May 5  the Delhi government had increased VAT from 27 per cent to 30 per cent on petrol and from 16.75 per cent to 30 per cent on diesel. The decision was taken to generate revenue as the economy had to come to a halt due to the lockdown. The hiked VAT on petrol has not been lowered. Petol is being sold at Rs 80.47 per litre in the capital. “Our main challenge now is to get the economy back on track. Many businesses are shut  industries are shut. This decision to lower VAT is an important step towards reviving the economy. We were getting representations from trade bodies that the high price of diesel was a source of difficulty ” Kejriwal said. The CM said that over the last one week  the Delhi government has taken several measures to boost the economy. The measures he listed included the launch of a job portal and allowing street vendors to resume business. “I am very happy that it has just been three-four days since we started the job portal. Around 7 577 companies have registered on the portal  2 04 785 jobs have been advertised here  and 3 22 865 job seekers have applied on the portal ” he said. Kejriwal once again appealed to traders  industrialists  and businessmen in the city to “join hands” to revive Delhi’s economy. “I want to appeal to all shopkeepers  traders and industrialists to open their shops and industries  maintain social distancing and wear masks but restart their operations and work. In the coming days  I will be meeting many industrialists and traders through video conferencing on Zoom and will try to resolve any issues that they are facing ” he said. ",delhi,ie
"Lt-Governor Anil Baijal Thursday overturned the Delhi Cabinet’s decision to appoint a panel of lawyers of its own choice to argue the February riots cases in the High Court and Supreme Court  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office said. Baijal invoked Article 239AA(4) of the Indian Constitution and referred the dispute to the President of India. In the interim  the panel of lawyers chosen by Delhi Police and approved by Baijal will argue the cases. “The L-G invoked special powers granted to him under the Constitution. The Home Department has been ordered to approve the panel chosen by the Delhi Police. The Delhi government will now have to implement the order at any cost as it is mandated by the Constitution ” a statement from the CM’s office said. The Northeast Delhi riots claimed at least 53 lives between February 23 and February 26. There were scores of injuries  widespread arson  and damage to property. Delhi Police proposed to the Delhi government to appoint six senior lawyers  including Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi  as Special Public Prosecutors in the Delhi High Court and Supreme Court in 85 cases related to riots and anti-CAA -protests. The government had opposed the proposal  which had the L-G’s backing. The matter was placed before the Cabinet on Tuesday based on the directions of the L-G  who could not invoke Article 239AA(4) till the Cabinet had taken a position on the issue. The Cabinet rejected the panel chosen by police  saying  “There have been allegations that the investigations of Delhi Police in these cases are biased and not impartial. The judiciary has also made adverse remarks against Delhi Police investigations on several occasions. Therefore  in order to ensure that all facts are presented before the Hon’ble judges  it is extremely critical that the government advocates are independent of the Police.” The Cabinet’s decision set the stage for Baijal to invoke Article 239AA(4)  citing “differences of opinion” with the elected government. In a statement  the Delhi government had targeted the L-G for his “repeated interferences” in the matter. The L-G had previously invoked Article 239AA(4) after a similar dispute arose over the appointment of public prosecutors to argue the riots cases in the lower courts. ",delhi,ie

"The Delhi High Court Thursday did not concur with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board’s insistence on physical presence of construction workers for renewal of their registration  observing that many labourers have already returned to their villages amid the pandemic and shut down of construction sites. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar also did not agree with the Board’s contention that the relaxation of physical presence will lead to allegations that it did not discharge its duty efficiently. “…Firstly  it is our suggestion that the verification process should be undertaken on telephone or through video-call. Secondly  the guidelines… state that the process of verification be undertaken online  telephonically or through video-call… Physical verification may also leave out many construction workers who are entitled to renewal of registration  since many of them have gone back to their native places on account of lockdown ” it said. The bench said that if the “physical verification is insisted upon  all such workers would not be able to renew their registration and receive their ex-gratia amount  till they return to Delhi. It may not happen for months…” It ordered the 25 advocates  who have been engaged as field verification officers for verifying applications for renewal of registration  to start their work “forthwith”. Applications for fresh registrations and renewals were received from May 15 to June 29  after a reduction in the number of workers registered with the board between 2015 and 2020 came under the HC’s scanner following a report in The Indian Express  based on a PIL by activist Sunil Kumar Aledia. With the number of active workers registered with the board in Delhi coming down from over 5 lakh to around 40 000  many could not avail the lockdown assistance of Rs 5 000 each disbursed in April and May from the cess fund. The Delhi government additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose and advocate Urvi Mohan  appearing for Delhi government and the Board  informed the court that they aggressively set up verification camps at construction sites as most workers do not have smartphones. “That will obviate the kind of hardship. The kind of inconvenience to the workers ” Ghose submitted. To which  the bench responded  “My registered mobile may not have that facility. (But) I can certainly borrow from co-workers or my superior’s phone for that purpose  to make a call or to talk (for verification)…” It further observed that there is a guideline in place for just an audio call or you can also go for the video call for verification of the details.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted  “The deaths due to corona in Delhi have come down. But it has to be reduced further. Today  we formed four committees of doctors which will inspect these hospitals and give suggestions: 1) where there are still more deaths  2) where there are more deaths in wards  which means the patient was not taken to ICU on time.” On Thursday  Delhi recorded 1 093 fresh cases  taking the tally to 1 34 403  while the death toll climbed to 3 936 with 29 more fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours.

"For a 16-year-old working as a waster picker in Noida  the Covid-19 pandemic has raised fears of contracting the virus through his profession. He and six others employed as waste pickers collect and separate waste  including used masks and gloves  from Jal Vayu Vihar in Sector 25 – with their bare hands. “We have not been provided gloves  masks or sanitisers. Some individuals had given us single-use gloves… We deal with waste from around 250 houses every day  we might contract coronavirus too. We repeatedly ask people to segregate their waste and put used masks and gloves in a separate packet and inform us. But they don’t… ” he said  adding that he collects waste from 30 buildings and earns Rs 100-Rs 150 a day. Anxiety peaked among waste pickers after some residents in the colony had tested positive. Sonu (32) said  “Even if I don’t want to pick up waste from a house where a Covid case has been detected  I don’t have an option.” Workers said they cannot wear plastic gloves as they tear easily while reusable gloves cost around Rs 150 – a price not all can afford. While Sonu wore a cloth mask  it kept falling off: “I bought it two months ago  it has become loose.” The seven workers are from West Bengal and live in Barola Village  Sector 49. After collecting waste  they spend an hour segregating it into piles – some of which can be sold to recycling companies.
Sonu said  “Most of our revenue comes from plastic  paper and glass bottles. We dump medical waste into the discard pile. We take the waste to our godown in Sector 49  where the scrap dealer pays us for the day. I usually make around Rs 250-Rs 300 a day. Before the lockdown  it was Rs 350-Rs 400.” He is the only earning member in his family and sends money to his wife and daughter every month.
AVM Pradeep Kumar  chairman of the Jal Vayu Vihar RWA  said the society has provided staff with face shields and gloves. But waste pickers maintained that they were given only to sanitation workers  not to them. Kumar said: “We have tried giving them gloves previously  but many don’t wear them… there are areas to wash hands in the society.” Vijay Rawal  Project Engineer (Public Health)  Noida Authority said  “Since they are unorganised workers  the onus is not on the society to provide them with anything. There is no authority who has this responsibility. However  if anyone demands it from us  we will provide them with the required items.” A similar situation prevailed in other colonies in Noida  where many waste pickers belong to the unorganised sector. While some workers have received sanitisers from individuals  Tarun Sarkar (35)  who earns Rs 100-150 daily  did not. “I do not know what a sanitiser is or what it is used for. I will be able to take precautions only if people give me gear. We cannot afford it ourselves. It’s almost as if poor people are immune to disease ” he said. Sonu  too  has run out of sanitiser. “I invested a huge portion of my savings every month on sanitisers… I don’t plan on buying one now ” he said. ",delhi,ie
"The problem of stray cattle in the city may increase as cow shelters have claimed they can’t accept any more animals unless the civic bodies clear dues. According to officials at the shelters  most of them are operating beyond capacity. The three MCDs send stray cattle to four shelters – Gopal Gausadan with a capacity of 3 200; Sri Krishna which has space for 7 600 cattle; Manav Gausadan which can accommodate 500 cattle; and Dabur Hare Krishna Gaushala in Surhera with a capacity of 4 000. The MCDs and the Delhi government contribute Rs 20 each per cow per day towards the maintenance of cattle in gaushalas. Federation of Gausadans general secretary and in-charge of Sri Krishna Gaushala in Bawana  Anand Jalan  said  “For around three years  North MCD has not given funds to us. We have a capacity of 7 600 cows but we have already exceeded the limit by 1 000… If we do not get funds  it will be difficult to take in any more animals.” A senior official of North MCD said that payment of over Rs 25 crore to cattle shelters has been pending over the last two years. The East body too has not paid since September 2018  and South since January this year. Krishan Yadav  who is in-charge of Dabur Hare Krishna  said: “It costs Rs 4 lakh a day to take care of 4 000 animals under us. We have exceeded the capacity but cattle are still sent to us.” Mayor of North MCD Jai Prakash said financial crunch has increased over the last few years because the Delhi government has reduced grants to the civic body: “We are in talks with the gaushalas  they will be given money soon.” Officials from the East and South MCDs said their revenue is down due to Covid and they haven’t received funds from the Delhi government. AAP leader Durgesh Pathak  however  blamed BJP for not running the MCDs properly and claimed the Delhi government has paid its share regularly to gaushalas. ",delhi,ie

"A week ago  when nursing officer Bhanu Sharma was on duty at Lok Nayak Hospital’s Covid-19 ICU  he got a call from a young patient’s husband that made the 30-year-old tear up — and sign up for plasma donation. “The patient is in her 30s… her husband requested me to somehow save her as they have a two-year-old daughter. I have a daughter of the same age too. I realised that apart from Covid duty  I must do everything else possible to save lives ” said Sharma  who had tested positive for the virus on June 13. On Monday  he donated plasma for the first time at Lok Nayak  where he has been working at since 2014. “I was hospitalised as I had trouble breathing and fever… I have been on that bed so I know what it feels like. Donating plasma was the most obvious decision ” said Sharma. For the last three days  Lok Nayak’s nursing officers have been donating plasma at a camp organised by the Nurses’ Union  said union head Jeemol Shaji. “Over 90 nursing officers tested positive while on duty serving Covid patients. All those who recovered and fit the donation criterion are doing their bit. We hope to inspire more people to come forward ” said Shaji. Among the donors was nursing officer Surendra Kumar Yadav (31)  who was asymptomatic and recovered by mid-June. A father of two  Yadav said  “While on Covid duty  I heard of young patients succumbing to the virus  some didn’t get plasma therapy… I know the success of the therapy is debatable but if my plasma can save even one life  I will consider myself lucky.” Yadav decided that as soon as he develops enough antibodies  he would donate plasma. On Monday  he was the first in line. On Wednesday  it was nursing officer Pradeep Barwar’s turn to donate plasma. The 33-year-old had recovered mid-June but the death of a few acquaintances due to Covid shook him up: “I can’t say if they would have survived if plasma was given but I had to do my bit for others. I will donate again if I get the chance.” The camp also saw a nursing officer from Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday. Athul Ravi (26) joined Safdarjung on May 30 and tested positive for the virus on June 23. After recovering and rejoining duty  Ravi got to know of a patient — from his home state  Kerala — who needed plasma. “We have a WhatsApp group of Keralites and someone posted about the patient and asked if I could donate. So I went to donate ” he said. In a bid to bridge the gap between Covid patients and plasma donors  a WhatsApp group called ‘Abhayam’ (meaning ‘shelter’ in Malayalam)  comprising 200 nursing officers and other staff at AIIMS  has come to their rescue. Coordinator Joseph C T (41) said  “The group has been active for a few months now and was aimed at providing help to needy patients outside AIIMS; then we realised there was a lack of blood in blood banks  so we started coordinating that. For a few weeks now  we have been helping patients get plasma.” In the group  messages of “plasma needed” are shared  and nurses who have recovered donate or spread the word. “Last week  an AIIMS nurse donated plasma and so did his brother  who is not an AIIMS employee… We want more people to come forward ” said Joseph.

"The Haryana Forest Department has employed aerial seeding technique to improve green cover in the Aravalli area of Faridabad. According to officials  the method involves spraying seed balls or seed pellets — seeds covered with a mixture of clay  compost  char  and other components — from the air. In Faridabad  these will be dispersed using “seeding drones” developed by a startup incubated at IIT-Kanpur. “In the context of the Aravalli region…  this will be specially useful since there are many areas that are either difficult to reach or inaccessible altogether  making traditional methods of plantation difficult ” said an official from the Faridabad forest department. Principal Chief Conservator of Forests Dr Amarinder Kaur said this project is being done in Haryana on a pilot basis “to regenerate the low vegetation density or denuded areas on inaccessible or difficult sites” of Aravalli and Shivalik hills. The method of plantation is being implemented on 100 acres of land during the pilot phase “to test efficacy of the seed dispersal mechanism and review the success rate”. It was implemented in Yamunanagar and Mahendragarh earlier in July. “It will also provide work opportunities to the local community  especially women  who can prepare the seed balls ” she said. The species that will be planted in the Aravalli areas include Acacia senegal (Khairi)  Ziziphus mauritiana (Beri)  and Holarrhena spp (Inderjo)  all of which have a higher chance of survival in these areas. Officials said “site specific” grass seeds will also be added to the mix as they serve as good soil binders. The seeding drone is capable of carrying 2 kg of seeds at a time. It is equipped with a “precise delivery mechanism” for seeds of different sizes  which it drops at predetermined intervals from a height of 25 to 50 metres. A single drone  officials said  can plant 20 000-30 000 seeds a day. Under phase 1 of the plantation in Faridabad  a five hectare area in the district’s Badkhal area will be targetted. “The drones will disperse 5 000 seeds per hectare. Survival rate in this sort of plantation tends to be low  less than 50%. So  the point of planting such a high quantity is that  even if the survival rate is 20%  we will have 1 000 trees ” said Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests  Vinod Kumar. Intervention from above What is aerial seeding? A plantation technique wherein seed balls — seeds covered with mixture of clay  compost  char and other components — are sprayed using aerial devices  including planes  helicopters or drones. How does it work? Seeds balls/pellets are dispersed in a targeted area by low-flying drones  with the coating providing
the required weight for seeds to airdrop on a pre-determined location rather than getting deterred by the wind. These pellets sprout when there is enough rain  with nutrients present within them helping in initial growth. What are its advantages? Areas that are inaccessible  having steep slopes or no forest routes  can be targeted using this method. The process of the seed’s germination and growth is such that it requires no attention after it is dispersed — the reason why seed pellets are known as the “fire and forget” way of plantation. They eliminate any need for ploughing and digging holes in the soil and do not need to be planted since they are already surrounded by soil  nutrients  and microorganisms. The clay shell also protects them from birds  ants and rats. What kind of species can be dispersed? Those native to the area and hardy  with seeds that are of an appropriate size for preparing seedballs  with a higher survival percentage. Officials say it is critical that the timing of the seeding be correct. ",delhi,ie
"AN AYURVEDA doctor  who is suspected by police to have been the mastermind behind at least 50 murders of taxi drivers in the early 2000s  and whose associates used to dump bodies in a canal infested with crocodiles to get rid of evidence  was arrested in Delhi Wednesday — six months after he jumped parole while serving a life sentence at the Central Jail in Jaipur. According to Delhi Police  Dr Devendra Sharma (62) was arrested from his residence in Delhi’s Baprola. He was also behind an illegal kidney transplant racket in the 1990s with a network spread across Jaipur  Ballabhgarh and Gurgaon  police said. “After jumping parole in Jaipur  he went back to his native village  then moved to Delhi  where he married a widow  and started living with her in Baprola. He started a property business  and even mediated for the sale of a building in Connaught Place to a person in Jaipur. This  too  was a cheating scam ” DCP (Crime Branch) Rakesh Paweriya said. The DCP said it was while gathering information of “wanted criminals in the area” that a Delhi Police Inspector got information that Sharma was living in Baprola. “We received information about him a week ago. A team had been deployed to search him then ” said police. Police said he was calm and didn’t try to run. His interrogation started on Tuesday afternoon and lasted till the early hours of Wednesday. When asked about media reports from back in the day about him having been involved in 100 murders  he is learnt to have told police: “I lost count after 50… it might have been 100. It is not easy to remember.” “He was arrested for several murder cases in 2002-04 and was convicted in 6-7 cases. He was released on parole for 20 days after staying in Jaipur’s Central Jail for 16 years ” said the DCP. He said he came to Delhi because he wanted to start a new life and live peacefully. Sharma was handed life term for the abduction and murder of a cab driver in Gurgaon in 2002. Malini Agarwal  Additional DG (Rajasthan Jails)  told The Indian Express: “He was granted parole on January 28 and was supposed to come back on February 16 but he went to Aligarh and didn’t return. Parole was granted by the district collector after a lot of verification  and Sharma was released on the basis of his conduct in the jail. He has been arrested in Delhi and is in Tihar Jail.” According to a police officer in Delhi  Sharma obtained his BAMS degree in Bihar where he began running his own clinic in 1984. In 1994  he suffered a financial setback of Rs 11 lakh when he invested in a gas dealership scheme after he got scammed. “A year later  his foray into the world of crime began when he started running a fake gas agency. Around the same time  he also began the illegal kidney transplant racket. During interrogation  he disclosed that from 1994-2004  he got more than 125 kidney transplants done illegally for which he was paid Rs 5-7 lakh each ” the officer said. The doctor ran his clinic on and off till 2003  when he got in touch with men who used to hire taxis  and kill the drivers at a secluded place. “They used to dump the bodies on the way to Aligarh in Hazara canal  Kasganj  which had crocodiles  and hence there was no chance of retrieval. Sharma used to sell the taxis in Kasganj or dismantle them in Meerut and make about Rs 25 000 per vehicle ” said an officer. ",delhi,ie
"Asking for “strict compliance”  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Wednesday said symptomatic people who test negative during a rapid antigen test (RAT) must be retested using RT-PCR. This came after he held a meeting with health department officials on Wednesday morning. “Existing guidelines say that if any patient’s antigen test is negative but has symptoms  RT-PCR test must be done on him. I directed officers today to ensure strict compliance of these guidelines ” he tweeted. As per Delhi Health department data  between June 18 and July 29  4.78 lakh rapid antigen tests were carried out. Of these  over 3.9 lakh were conducted from July 1-July 29. The number of RT-PCR tests conducted in this period were 1.8 lakh  less than half of rapid antigen tests. Till July 23  2 818 people (showing symptoms) were re-tested through RT-PCR method  of which 404 tested positive. Rapid antigen tests  which provide results within 30 minutes  started in Delhi on June 18. While the sensitivity of RT-PCR tests is 70%  that of antigen tests is 40%. This is why ICMR advises governments to make symptomatic patients undergoing RAT and testing negative to get re-tested through RT-PCR. While sensitivity of antigen tests is lesser  they are helpful in expanding testing at a faster rate  especially in containment zones  health centres and among special surveillance groups prone to getting infected. On Monday  the Delhi High Court had asked the Delhi government why it was going with rapid antigen testing  which has a higher rate of false negative results as compared to RT-PCR  as the primary mode of Covid testing. “Should we go by RAT at all  instead of RT-PCR?” a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad had said. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has also written to the Delhi government to increase testing through RT-PCR. A sero-survey conducted by NCDC recently found over 23% Delhi residents have developed antibodies against the infection. Dr Lalit Kant  former head (Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases Division)  ICMR  told The Indian Express: “Rapid antigen test is high on specificity and low on sensitivity  and can give false negatives. If a person has symptoms and tests negative by rapid antigen test  then he/she should be tested by RT-PCR. This is based on the fact that sensitivity of RT-PCR is higher than that of rapid test. Sensitivity is the probability that a person with disease tests positive. What we do not know yet is how infectious is a person who is rapid test negative and RT-PCR positive. Research on this would be useful for refining testing strategies.” At rapid test centres  those who test negative are handed out small slips of paper  bearing the words “this is to certify that Mr/Ms NAME has not tested positive in the Rapid Diagnostic Test for Covid 19… if you are symptomatic  then you must continue to isolate yourself and get an RT-PCR test done as this test does not rule out Covid-19 infection” in English. On Wednesday  the city saw 1 035 new cases and 26 deaths. The total case load is now 1 33 310 and the death toll stands at 3 907. ",delhi,ie
"The Supreme Court Wednesday warned of contempt action against IIT-Bombay after it backed out of the proposed smog tower pilot project in the capital. “How can they back out from a government project? We will draw contempt against them. What is this nonsense?” a bench of Justice Arun Mishra  Justice Vineet Saran and Justice M R Shah remarked after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed it about IIT’s withdrawal. “It was stated by the learned Solicitor General that they have been unable to enter into any agreement with IIT-B. IIT has now backed out. These are dilly-dallying tactics; a violation of the order passed by this court has already been committed… by IIT ” the court said in its order. The Indian Express had reported on July 29 that the timeline for setting up two smog towers in Delhi — at Anand Vihar and Connaught Place — will have to be revised as IIT-Bombay  which was heading the pilot project  has “backed out”. Coming down heavily on the institute  the bench said  “We have to proceed against IIT-B as well as against persons concerned for violating this court’s order and backing out from the basis of the order…” The court’s reference was to its January 13 direction to set up smog towers in the capital to combat increasing air pollution. “It is not expected of such institutions to act in the manner projected in a matter relating to public interest. It is shocking that such conduct is projected by such a public functionary ” it said. Stating that it is “not at all happy with the state of affairs”  the court directed that its order “be complied with forthwith  otherwise it would be taken seriously”. The bench asked Mehta to call the official concerned from IIT-B to explain its conduct. The SG sought a day’s time  following which the court posted the matter for Thursday. Mehta also told the bench that authorities are in talks with IIT-Delhi and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) for the project.Meanwhile  the Union Environment Ministry and Central Pollution Control Board told the court in an affidavit that they had convened a meeting on July 27 with IIT-Delhi  NEERI and NBCC Ltd and they “have agreed to take up the project”.

"North MCD’s leader of the House Yogesh Kumar Verma served a legal notice to AAP MLAs Atishi and Raghav Chadha over their allegations that the civic body has been unable to pay salaries to healthcare workers at its hospitals because of “corruption”. Both shot back at a press conference  saying they will not be silenced. Verma threatened civil and criminal defamation proceedings against the two leaders  saying they are liable to pay Rs 1 crore if they do not issue unconditional apologies in a week. Verma  in the legal notice  claimed the MCD’s earnings from property tax during the last quarter of 2019-20 reduced by over 53% compared to the corresponding quarter in 2018-19. In the notice  Verma conceded the civic body is not left with sufficient funds to pay salaries to “some doctors and health workers” due to the drop in income between January and June 2020 and Delhi government “withholding” its dues to the MCD. He said the statements by Atishi and Chadha contain “reckless imputations likely to affect” his reputation. Atishi told The Indian Express: “He himself conceded the MCD could not pay doctors and healthcare workers. The Delhi government  in an affidavit in the HC  said it has cleared all dues; we are not saying this. Where has the money gone? Secondly  against how many people will they file defamation notices? CAG has pointed out irregularities  a former North MCD commissioner has said so. Every citizen of Delhi holds the MCD as corrupt.” Chadha said the BJP should try and find a single person who believes the civic bodies are not dens of corruption: “BJP leaders Manoj Tiwari and Vijay Goel have also called MCD corrupt in the past. Will he (Kumar) file defamation suits against them as well? We will hit the streets and go to the people against this notice.” ",delhi,ie
"The Bombay High Court has directed the state government to inform the family of activist Anand Teltumbde  one of the accused in the Elgar Parishad case  about the outcome of the Covid-19 test done on him on Thursday. A Division Bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht on Friday heard a petition by activist Vernon Gonsalves (61) and professor Teltumbde (68)  who were co-accused Varavara Rao’s co-inmates at Taloja Central Jail  seeking they should be tested for Covid-19 for being in close contact with Rao. Telugu poet and activist Rao was shifted to Nanavati Hospital on July 19 for neurological and urological treatment. He had been undergoing treatment at the state-run St George Hospital since July 16 after testing positive for Covid-19. On July 28  responding to the plea  public prosecutor Thakare said Gonsalves had undergone a Covid-19 test and was ascertained negative for the same. The jail authorities also said Gonsalves would be allowed to speak to his wife through video-conference. The state  meanwhile  had said it will respond to Teltumbde’s plea to undergo Covid-19 test by Friday. On Friday  senior advocate Mihir Desai for applicants informed the court that as Gonsalves had tested negative for Covid and had informed his family about it. However  Desai submitted that the family of Teltumbde was anxious as they were unaware of the status of his Covid-19 test and that he had not spoken to the family as well. The state be directed to inform whether Teltumbde had been tested for Covid-19 infection and provide the result for the same  Desai said. Public Prosecutor Thakare for state informed the High Court that Teltumbde was tested on Thursday  July 30  and his report would be available Saturday  which would be submitted to the Court on Tuesday. After hearing submissions  the bench directed the state to inform Teltumbde’s family about the Covid-19 test result and also let family speak to him and posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday  August 4. Meanwhile  the High Court had on July 28 directed the Nanavati Super-Specialty Hospital  Vile Parle  to submit a health report of Varavara Rao  an accused in the Elgaar Parishad case  within three days from the time the hospital received communication on the court’s order.

"HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh Thursday said the COVID-hit economy is likely to recover on the back of the rural sector and “signs of the wheels of the economy beginning to churn are evident”. “Today  the bright spot for India is the rural economy. A good monsoon  strong agricultural growth and government support through rural employment guarantee schemes is enabling rural consumption to lead India’s overall recovery ” Parekh said while addressing HDFC’s virtual AGM. He said foodgrain production is expected to hit a record high of over 292 million tonnes. Kharif sowing has been healthy too. “Certain sectors are limping back to normalcy  but the strong probability of cycling in and out of lockdowns does remain ” Parekh said. “My view is that one should not be too perturbed with forecasts of negative GDP growth rates. Most believe India’s GDP growth which was slowing down in the pre-Covid era will contract by about 5 per cent this year ” he said  adding  “recovery will happen assuming no further lengthy and complete lockdowns in future.” Since Independence  India has had a recession only 3 times — 1958  1966 and 1980  Parekh said. In each of these years  the reason was the same — a poor monsoon which hit agriculture  and at that time agriculture was a sizable part of the Indian economy  he added. Parekh said signs of the wheels of the economy beginning to churn are evident from the fact that unemployment rates have tapered down from their peaks in May  e-toll collections are higher as are e-way bills  digital transactions and GST collections are back to Rs 90 000-crore levels. Demand for two-wheelers and tractors have risen  even though passenger and commercial vehicle demand remains subdued  he said. “It has been an extremely challenging time for everyone … Yet  from the utter despair that the world was in towards the end of March and the month of April since then  there has been a great deal of stability in the financial markets ” Parekh said. In India  various fiscal and policy measures have ensured that there is adequate liquidity in the system. Interest rates are the lowest in the last 10 years  he said. ",mumbai,ie
"A MISSING persons complaint filed by the father of a 28-year-old man  who had gone missing along with his 22-year-old wife  ended up in a murder case. The police on Thursday arrested 28-year-old Ambuj Tiwari for allegedly murdering his wife Neelam and disposing of her body in Lonavala. Police also arrested his friend  Srikant Choube (24)  for allegedly helping him dispose of the body. Police said Tiwari’s father Mahendra approached the police on July 23  stating that both his son Ambuj  who worked at Kurla as a quality supervisor in a cement mixing firm  and his daughter-in-law Neelam  a home-maker  were missing from their residence since a day. The couple have a four-year-old son  who was with his grandparents. ACP Vinayak Vast said they began looking for the duo and eventually found Tiwari in Ghansoli area on Tuesday. During interrogation when he was asked about Neelam  he did not give a proper answer  Vast said. He was then further interrogated  where he confessed to have murdered his wife and dumped her body in Lonavala  said police. The police team reached the spot where Tiwari claimed to have dumped the body in a blue drum and recovered it. “Neelam’s decomposed body was found in the drum ” Vast said. The police then registered a case of murder and arrested Tiwari. He told the police that he suspected Neelam was having an affair  something that led to regular fights between them. The duo got married in 2016 and in the last two years they fought frequently. On July 23  he told his wife that they should go to stay at his friend’s house in Navi Mumbai  which was empty and resolve their differences  police said. “However  early in the morning they had a fight again and he strangled her with a dupatta ” Vast said. When Choube  at whose house the murder took place  came home  Tiwari told him about the incident. The duo then put her body in a drum and took it in a tempo owned by Choube. On the Mumbai-Pune Highway  they pushed the drum in the bushes near Lonavala. After returning  Tiwari was staying at a friend’s place from where he was arrested. ",mumbai,ie
"THE BMC will face a tough time attaining its revenue target of Rs 28 448 crore set for the financial year 2020-21 as officials have claimed that the civic body was staring at a shortfall of close to Rs 14 000 crore. Looking at the shortfall  the civic body has now proposed a 10 per cent cut in overall budget estimates. The BMC has so far incurred about Rs 4 000 crore shortfall in the last four months. Till July  the corporation has collected only about Rs 980 crore  civic officials said. “The ongoing situation of lockdown due to Covid-19 and dip in revenue will cause losses from Rs 12 000 crore to Rs 14 000 crore for 2020-21  which is half the income projected in budget ” said a senior BMC official. According to officials  the civic body has set a target of Rs 28 448 crore revenue for this financial year. In February  then municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had presented Rs 33 441 crore budget estimate for 2020-21. The civic body is already facing a financial burden  even as Pardeshi proposed many financial curbs in his budget speech  including no new hiring and outsourcing. The shortfall in revenue has forced the civic body to prepare a plan of cost saving in all departments. A source from the BMC said major departments like roads  storm water drain  sewerage projects  water supply projects  and solid waste management will face cuts in their expenditure. On overall budget estimate  the cost saving would be up to Rs 3 500 crore. Big projects  however  like coastal road and health department will not have any impact. “We are looking at around Rs 2 500 crore to Rs 3 500 crore cost saving for this financial year. An overall plan of changes in the budget has been prepared and it is under discussion ” said a senior BMC officer. Civic officials said the slow pace of ongoing development works and no new projects due to lockdown had provided some “relief” as expenditure had also gone down. This had helped the civic body save some amount  officials said. “We are saving some expenditure on ongoing big projects as the pace of the work has slowed down due to the current situation. Also  no new projects have taken off in the last four months ” Additional Municipal Commissioner  (Projects)  P Velrasu  also in-charge of the finance department  told The Indian Express. When asked about department-wise cut in the budget  Velrasu said  “It is premature to reveal from which departments we have proposed cost cutting since it’s in the draft stage. Some internal discussions are yet to take place and the proposal will also be shared with group leaders before being finalised.” He also said big projects like coastal road and health department would not face any impact as the foundation of the corporation is strong. Opposition leader in the BMC  Ravi Raja said revenues from property tax and premiums from building construction  which were major sources of income  had recorded massive dip. ",mumbai,ie

His elder brother Nilesh Deshmukh claims that he is likely to have got infected while performing his daily duty. His initial complaints of weakness and stomach ache were diagnosed as acidity problems by a local doctor. However  on July 11 a drop in his sugar levels led to him being admitted and discharged on the same day. “After seeing his blood report  the doctors said that he may be suffering from cancer as his WBC count was much higher. I had gone to meet a cancer specialist in Dadar on July 15 to get a second opinion but he passed away the next day ” said Nilesh. His test report showed that he was Covid-19 positive.  Sachin Patil  (41) Designation: Police Sub-Inspector of Vikhroli police station Years of service: 15 Patil had joined as a constable and was promoted as sub inspector in 2012.

"The Maharashtra government will discuss the latest findings of Mumbai’s sero survey with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to assess whether the city has reached the stage of community transmission  state Health Minister Rajesh Tope told The Indian Express on Thursday. “The state government is not an authority to decide upon this. The World Health Organisation and ICMR should say about community transmission in Maharashtra and India. They have expertise ” he said  adding  “Yes we are seeing a high seroprevalence in some slums. This might be because of common toilets. But in residential areas  the prevalence is still 15-16 per cent. We can not yet say entire city or state is seeing community transmission ” Tope said. A sero survey conducted in first fortnight of July by BMC  along with Niti Aayog and Tata Institute of Fundamental Research  found in slums 57 per cent people were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and had developed antibodies  and in non-slums 16 per cent had developed antibodies. This survey excluded containment zones. Researchers who conducted the survey said if containment zones were included the seroprevalence will be much higher city. Read: Mumbai Sero Survey; Senior citizens most exposed in slums “Even now 80-90 per cent cases are coming from containment zones or from institutional quarantine  very few from outside. We are only seeing widespread transmission in some slums of Mumbai ” Tope said. The minister said the ICMR is aware of sero surveillance report from Mumbai and “has technical expertise to decide”. On July 17  Kerela Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was first to admit there is local community transmission in two coastal hamlets in the state. A week later  Telangana health authorities also indicated presence of community transmission  asking people to remain vigilant for next three to four weeks.

"Senior citizens in slums were most exposed to SARS-CoV-2 among all age groups  while senior citizens in non-slums were least exposed to the virus  according to Mumbai’s sero survey findings. In slums  62.6 per cent senior citizens had been exposed and developed antibodies against Covid-19  as opposed to 12.6 per cent in residential buildings. Of the 4 234 slum-dwellers who were surveyed  56.1 per cent between 12-24 years  52.9 per cent between 25-40 years  59.6 per cent between 41-60 years  and 62.6 per cent aged above 60 had developed antibodies. In non-slums where 2 702 people were tested  the trend reversed. In the 12-24 year bracket  18.8 per cent had developed antibodies  decreasing to 15.8 per cent in the 25-40 age group  15.9 per cent in the 41-60 age group  and to a mere 12.6 per cent in the 60 year plus group surveyed. “The government’s advisory asked senior citizens to stay at home. This finding iterates that in non-slums  educated and well-aware people took maximum precaution in that age group and were least exposed ” said Dr Pradeep Vyas  state health secretary. He added that in slums  senior citizens had no option of preventing physical distancing due to shared toilets and were most vulnerable to the infection. “It is also a matter of joy that in slums we have reached this level of immunity ” he added. Scientists were more circumspect. Dr Jayanthi Shastri  head of microbiology in Nair hospital  said  “This could also be a coincidental finding. There may be no co-relation with age ” she said. Professor Sandeep Juneja  Dean of School of Technology and Computer Science in Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)  who was part of the team that conducted the survey  also said at this point “it is hard to draw conclusions”. Dr Daksha Shah  deputy executive health officer  BMC  said these are findings that will have to be analysed when a second sero survey is conducted. The sero survey  conducted in July first two weeks jointly by BMC  TIFR  and Niti Aayog  found sero prevalence in slums 3.5 times higher than in non-slums. In Matunga (F North) where 3 327 samples were collected  57.8 per cent people in slum were exposed and had developed antibodies  as opposed to 17.4 in non-slum pockets. In Chembur (M-West) 2 460 samples were taken  slums had seroprevalence of 56.7 per cent and non-slums 15.6 per cent. Dahisar (R-North)  where 1 149 samples were collected  has seroprevalence of 51 per cent in slums and 11.4 per cent in non-slums  the lowest amongst all three wards. The survey found that infection fatality rate was lower in slums than non slums  although the exposure was much higher in slums. Women living in both  slums and residential buildings  seemed to have been more exposed to Covid-19 and developed faster immunity than men. In slums  59.3 per cent of women tested had developed antibodies as opposed to 53.2 per cent men. In residential buildings  16.8 per cent of total women tested had developed antibodies  and only 14.9 per cent men. A second sero survey  starting August 10  will study in greater detail what role gender plays in Covid-19 infection and mortality. ",mumbai,ie

"A 36-YEAR-OLD undertrial was found dead in Taloja central jail on Wednesday. Jail authorities said the prisoner hanged himself in the hospital ward. The deceased was identified as Dinesh Narkar. A police official said he was found dead at 8.30 pm  when guards in charge of the hospital ward were taking over duty for their shift and going to each cell to count the prisoners. The official said the hospital doctor checked Narkar and declared him dead. Senior Inspector Pradip Tidar of Kharghar police station said an accidental death was registered. Narkar  a resident of Prabhadevi  was arrested earlier this month for an alleged attempt to murder and relevant sections of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act on a complaint filed by his wife.

An official said he was later moved to the jail on July 20  after his test reports were negative  but he was in the hospital ward of the jail as he had reported weakness. When his body was sent for a post-mortem  family members demanded an inquiry into his death and alleged foul play  police said. Police also said a magistrate conducted an inquest and will submit a report after an inquiry into the custodial death. A judicial inquiry is mandatory in cases of custodial death  as per provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.

"To Facilitate the smooth movement of trains on the suburban section  the Western Railway (WR) on Thursday relaxed speed restrictions imposed on a 1.5-km section between Khar and Bandra. It is one of the longest speed restrictions between Mumbai Central and Virar  which was affecting train movement. The move has enabled local trains and long-distance trains to move at a full speed of 100 kmph  sanctioned speed of the section against the previously permissible limit of up to 60 kmph. According to officials  this will enable every train to save up to 30 seconds while crossing the section and further have a similar effect on the movement of other trains. According to officials from the WR  at least 17 turnout points  where trains switch from one track to the other  had to be moved and another 400 m of track was moved to enable the relaxation. Sumit Thakur  chief PRO of the WR  said  “The lockdown came in handy to complete the challenging task  which required tracks to be shifted. Both suburban and long-distance trains will now move at an enhanced speed.” The WR has also completed the construction of another foot overbridge between Andheri and Jogeshwari  which is the fourth to be completed and commissioned during the lockdown.

"The Maharashtra government has said the Maratha community will not be entitled to avail the 10 per cent reservation in jobs and education for economically weaker sections (EWS) in the general category in the state. A Government Resolution (GR)  issued on July 28  said the Maratha community is covered under socially and educationally backward classes and hence it cannot avail the 10 per cent reservation under EWS for state government jobs and admissions to educational institutions in Maharashtra. The 10 per cent quota  a Centre-enacted law  is meant for economically weaker sections in the open category  who cannot avail any other social reservations  it said. In the Union government list  the Maratha community is not included among backward classes and hence it is entitled to reservation for recruitment in central government jobs under the EWS category. But  the EWS reservation will not be applicable for Maratha community candidates in state government jobs and admissions to educational institutions in Maharashtra  the order said. The GR said there have been complaints that reserved category candidates have got EWS certificates. Tehsildars (revenue officials) should verify and cross check to ensure the candidate who is being given an EWS certificate doesnt fall under any other reserved category  it said. Officers concerned should also ensure that EWS certificates taken to avail central government jobs are not used at the state-level  the GR said. The Maharashtra government had enacted the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act  2018  to grant reservation to the Maratha community in jobs and education. The Bombay High Court  while upholding the law in June last year  had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and said that quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions. The Maratha quota law has been challenged in the Supreme Court. ",mumbai,ie
"Maharashtra  Mumbai  Thane Coronavirus Live Updates: Maharashtra Thursday reported its highest single-day spike of 11 147 COVID-19 cases  taking the overall tally to 4 11 798. The state’s death toll increased by 266 to 14 729. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray Thursday reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Pune district  which has recorded more than 78 000 cases so far and seen a spurt in infections in recent weeks. He urged elected representatives in Pune to be the connecting point between local residents and the administration in efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. On the day infections in Maharashtra crossed the 4 lakh mark  the state government Wednesday extended the lockdown till August 31. Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar said the state remains “threatened with the spread of Covid-19”  adding that restrictions would be eased in a “phase wise manner with SOPs”. Under the new guidelines announced by the state  malls and market complexes will be allowed to function from 9 am to 7 pm. However  theatres  food courts and restaurants will remain closed. Further  the night curfew will remain in place in the state despite the Centre doing away with it. Meanwhile  the Union Health Ministry has said given the size of India’s population  herd immunity “cannot be a strategic choice or option”  and urged people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour till a vaccine is developed. The ministry also informed that phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials of two indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates have started. ",mumbai,ie
"WHILE THE BJP is set to observe the Ram temple groundbreaking ceremony on August 5 with much fanfare  the Shiv Sena is likely to keep cerebrations low-key amid the pandemic. On Wednesday  party leaders and functionaries said the party has not issued any instructions on the celebrations of the Ram temple groundbreaking ceremony yet. “A decision on it will be taken soon ” Sanjay Raut  Sena MP  said. Referring to the restrictions imposed by the state government on the various religious festivals due to the pandemic  a Sena leader said  “So  the celebrations may be low-key to avoid large gatherings of people.” Another party functionary said Chief Minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had suggested that a virtual ‘bhoomi pujan’ of the Ram temple should be held due to the pandemic. “The party chief had also raised the question that a large gathering may lead to a further spread of the coronavirus. So  it is difficult to hold the celebrations with a large gathering ” the functionary added. Chandrakant Khaire  a senior Sena leader and former MP from Aurangabad  meanwhile  said  “We are planning to organise some celebrations on August 5 while abiding by all the lockdown guidelines and Covid-19 preventive measures.” While Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to visit Ayodhya  Uttar Pradesh  on August 5 for the groundbreaking ceremony for the Ram temple  the state BJP leadership has announced that the day would be celebrated with much fanfare in Maharashtra while following Covid-19 measures. The Sena has been vocal about the Ram temple with Thackeray has visited Ayodhya three times in the last two years  including his visit in March to mark the completion of 100 days in office as Chief Minister. The BJP  however  has accused that the Sena of abandoning Hindutva after it joined hands with the NCP and the Congress for forming the Maha Vikas Aghadi government. The Sena has maintained that there has been no change in the party’s stand. Even its alliance partners have also not opposed Uddhav’s visit to Ayodhya stating that it is the matter of his personal faith. NCP chief Sharad Pawar had recently said he was not against the construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya as the Supreme Court has given the verdict on it. “But the ceremony should be held with fewer people to avoid crowding and spreading the coronavirus ” Pawar said. Ashok Chavan  senior Congress leader and state PWD Minister  too  had referred to the SC verdict on the Ram temple. “So  the invitations should be given to political parties who want to go for ‘bhoomi pujan’. All the places of worship have been closed due to Covid-19 and it is not desirable to hold the big gathering for the event. It would be good if a virtual programme is held ” Chavan added.

"As job losses and salary cuts across sectors became rampant during the four months of the lockdown imposed in the city due to the Covid-19 pandemic  family court lawyers fielded calls from clients seeking the court’s intervention for waiver or reduction in payment of maintenance to separated wives and children. An actor  who paid maintenance of Rs 70 000 per month to his former wife and son  has been out of work through the lockdown and has expressed inability to pay even half the amount with his income reduced to nothing. “The wife is a journalist and has a fixed takeaway  even if there may be salary cuts  but in his case  his income was reduced to zero. First  he called me and said he can pay Rs 30 000 in maintenance and now he says he can’t even afford that because he has had no income through the months of lockdown ” said family court lawyer Vandana Shah. She said her client asked why he should continue to pay this amount for daily needs when he paid for the child’s school fee  extracurricular activities and travel abroad. A large number of divorce cases filed in the family court in Bandra are contested over the payment of maintenance or recovery of maintenance arrears. Although tendency to skirt the payment of alimony to the wife is common  family court lawyers said courts have  more often than not  been strict in such cases and ensured the woman was paid her due whether it was a case of divorce or domestic violence. In the face of the pandemic and subsequent losses of jobs and income  however  the courts too have a new set of facts to take into account while deciding cases contested over payment of maintenance. Shah said amid the lockdown  even the Bombay High Court had granted relief to a man unable to pay interim maintenance because he had lost his job. The court reduced the maintenance amount  she said. “It’s only going to get worse because judges have also become very spare keeping in mind the pandemic and that people have lost jobs  they are not getting jobs back ” said Shah. Through the months of lockdown  the family court has been working with 15 per cent staff. While all the judges continue to hear cases online  cases are prioritised based on urgency. The 14 marriage counsellors attached to the court have also been carrying out their work through video conference. Petitions are filed online and allotted a token number for the next day to file documents for verification. A counter for verification has been set up outside and no one other than the staff and lawyers are allowed inside the building that has been following a strict sanitisation protocol  a court official said. While cases seeking a waiver or reduction of maintenance amounts have already got family court lawyers drafting interim applications  lawyer Mridula Kadam said in such cases  they would have to file an interim application citing “changed circumstances” and urge the court to review its earlier application in which the order of maintenance may be passed. “I got a call from a banker who said he could no longer pay the same maintenance amount that he was paying because he has had to take a pay cut. It is easier for a salaried person to show the reduction in his income with a salary certificate but for businessmen it’s more difficult. Like in case of a restaurateur  he will have to show that the restaurant was closed for so many months and he had no income ” said Kadam. This is an “obvious consequence” of job loss and pay cuts  said lawyer Amit Karkhanis. “Once the courts reopen fully there will be several applications for modification of maintenance amounts. They will all seek a cut in maintenance that may be in proportion with the husband’s income. This may  however  be harsh on women ” said Karkhanis. Women’s rights lawyer Veena Gowda  said the pandemic and job losses may just be another excuse for men who tried to evade the payment of maintenance. The situation will have a more adverse effect on economically disadvantaged women. She said courts must step in to ensure some sort of immediate relief for women. This  she said  was also a good time to relook at matrimonial laws. “We really tend to ignore patriarchy when we look at this concept of ‘family’. When we see the pendency of cases in the family court  a lot of them are pendency of recovery of (maintenance) arrears. Even in middle-class  upper middle class it is becoming an excuse not to pay and harass the woman. They know there is not much the courts are going to do now because their matters won’t come up as urgent ” said Gowda. ",mumbai,ie
"MUMBAI CRIME branch has arrested a 42-year-old man  Safdar Momin  for allegedly trying to pass off low-quality face masks as N95 masks and seized masks worth Rs 29 lakh. Police suspect more people  based out of Delhi  are involved in the crime. Assistant Police Inspector  Mumbai crime branch (Unit III) Nitin Patil said they received a tip-off that Momin  who runs a textile business in Bhiwandi  had been selling low-quality masks to a godown in Lower Parel. The accused had claimed that the masks had been produced by Venus company – the company produces high-quality masks that are used by hospitals. Based on the tip-off  police arrested Momin and seized 10 000 face masks  with logos of the Venus company  from a tempo. After employees of the Venus company  who were called in to check the quality of the masks  confirmed that the product had not been made by them and was of poorer quality  police said Momin was arrested and an FIR was registered against him at NM Joshi Marg police station. “During interrogation  we have found a few more leads and there might be more arrests in the case soon. Providing low-quality masks in the name of N95 masks can put those in the medical sector at risk ” Patil said.
N95 masks are personal protective equipment that protects the wearer from airborne particles and from liquid contaminating the face. ",mumbai,ie
"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has once again revised the protocol to seal buildings where one or more residents are detected with Covid-19. As per the amended protocol  issued Wednesday  the civic body will now seal a building completely only if more than three positive cases were reported. “If three or more Covid-19 cases are reported from a building  then the civic body will seal a building completely. If fewer than three cases are reported  then civic officials will only seal a particular floor of the building and no restriction will be imposed on the movement of other residents ” a senior official from R South ward said. The move comes in the backdrop of complaints from citizens who had taken exception to the BMC’s decision  issued last week  to seal an entire building located in the western suburbs and restrict the movement of its residents for 14 days after a single Covid-19 case was detected. According to civic officials  soon after BMC had issued the guidelines to seal buildings completely if single Covid-19 case was reported  several residents and politicians had complained that they were facing problems to go to work or buy groceries. Local political leaders had also approached the Additional Municipal Commissioner  Suresh Kakani  to apprise him of the problems that people were facing. Shiv Sena leader and former corporator from Dahisar  Abhishek Ghosalkar  said  “Residents will face a lot of problems if an entire building is sealed if one infection case was reported. As the state government has relaxed the lockdown  many offices and businesses have resumed. If an entire building is sealed then nobody can go out  which will  in turn  affect their work/businesses.” Ghosalkar had also raised the issue with senior civic officials. The civic body had revised its guidelines on sealing buildings following a spurt in Covid-19 cases in Kandivali  Borivali and Dahisar areas. As per the BMC’s wardwise data  Covid-19 growth rate in the three areas is between 1.1 per cent and 1.7 per cent  which is higher than Mumbai’s daily average of 1.02 per cent. The virus doubling rate for these areas is also less than the city’s average of 69 days. There are 526 sealed buildings in Kandivali  673 in Borivali and 213 in Dahisar. These sealed buildings together have reported more than 2 600 cases  as per civic data. The amended guidelines  officials said  will be implemented in R South (Kandivali)  R Central (Borivali) and R North (Dahisar) wards from Wednesday. ",mumbai,ie
"Professor Dr Ullas Kolthur Seetharam and Professor Sandeep Juneja  Dean of School of Technology and Computer Science  at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)  discuss Mumbai’s sero survey which they conducted along with BMC and Niti Aayog and its implications. Excerpts from an interview with The Indian Express The sero survey in Mumbai covers only about 7 000 people. Similar surveys in Delhi covered 21 387 people and in Spain 61 075 people. Don’t you think 7 000 may not represent whole of Mumbai with its 18 million population? Sundeep Juneja: We are only sampling three wards  so we can’t claim to represent entire Mumbai. For all we know other wards may have entirely different findings. But we have adequate numbers from these three wards. by restricting ourselves to slums and non-slums in three wards  we restrict the geographical variation  so that with the data we have  our estimate of prevalence is statistically reasonable. In slums our estimate of 57 percent seropravalence may have a plus-minus of 2-3 percent statistical error.
Seroprevalence in the slums of three wards was 50 to 60 per cent and in non slums  11 to 18 per cent. Dr Ullas Kultur Seetharam: Of course  numbers matter. But even within these wards  we looked at five slums that were spread out. We looked at random sampling that is representative of slums. We went to every fourth building in a non-slum to get a large area. This will still give you representation of the city. What could change our seroprevalence per cent is active containment zones. We deliberately left those out. If containment zones were included  the seroprevalence would have been higher. The only stark finding is difference we found in slums and non-slums  which would be uniform across the city. What about behaviour pattern  did you measure the adherence to mask-wearing  hand hygiene and whether that played a role in exposure? Juneja: We did not question people whether they wore masks or not. In slums  it is hard to maintain social distancing  they have common toilets. Economic constraints are more in slums  they have to step out to work so probably that is why they are exposed.
Seetharam: Yes  in non-slums people can work from home. In slums  even if they want to adhere to rules  they cannot possibly maintain social distancing. What are you looking at in the next sero survey? Juneja: We want to measure change in a month  how much has seroprevalence changed  what the infection rate is. We will visit the same areas  same wards. Seetharam: We will sample a different population but in same areas. We want to do a deep dive  it is not possible to do that in such short time if we sample all wards in city. We will start from August 10  it will take two weeks to take samples and another week to analyse them. Why or how do you think Mumbai has managed to reach seroprevalence of 40.5 per cent. The first case came on March 11. New York and Spain recorded cases much before and still have low prevalence. Juneja: But if we look at non-slums in Mumbai  which has 16 per cent seroprevalence  there is not much difference between New York and Mumbai. Seetharam: One could say that infection fatality rate is higher in New York and lesser in Mumbai (infection fatality is number of people dying against total infected). That needs to be studied  but any person getting infected in New York vis a vis Mumbai  there is less likelihood of dying  in Mumbai. Why? Juneja: Age is a factor. Indians are younger demographically. Even between slums and non-slums  our assumption is slum population is younger than non-slums. Have you advised any change in Covid strategy to BMC after this survey? Seetharam: BMC has on its own changed its focus from slums to non-slums  because they were seeing more cases come from the non-slums even before this survey. Juneja: Isolation of symptomatic people immediately is important. Using these numbers  they should focus on ensuring more beds are available. Because infection is still there. Such big numbers might scare  but what is more scary is not being able to get a bed. I think BMC should focus on that. What about opening up the city? Juneja: The economy is of concern. These numbers are reassuring  they tell us there will be no dramatic increase in numbers if we open the city a little bit. And we take it from there. If trains have to be opened up  it has to be very  very gradual. We have to see how the infection spreads. Seetharam: When the economy is opened up  activities must be allowed in a less crowded environment. There are merits and demerits of lockdown  and that has to be weighed based on at what time point the disease is. There are socio-economic factors  logistics  which I am sure BMC will weigh. Are there any projection models TIFR has worked on? Juneja: We are working on that model. The big unknown is what happens if trains open up. That could change the projection a lot. Did you look at comorbidity in this survey? Juneja: Infection fatality rate is lower in slums than non-slums. One reason is that slum population is younger. One reason may be that slum populations are younger. Other reason may be that non-slum people also have more co-morbidities than slum dwellers. We will attempt to analyse these in our study. Seetharam: We looked at whether people who were surveyed had respiratory illnesses  had co-morbidities and how many people live in a household. We will analyse household density data. We have to study all this.

 More women have been exposed than men. What could this mean? Seetharaman: It could mean two things; there could be a difference in social behaviour  that women step out more than men to buy groceries or it could mean there is a biological difference in both genders. It is difficult to assess now.
Juneja: It could point to more robustness in women  that they are surviving this infection better than men. This survey has raised hopes for herd immunity… Seetharaman: Yes  but we don’t know how long that immunity will last or memory of infection will last. Evidence is only emerging on that. Our next sero survey will check if there is change in prevalence  this could provide answers to whether herd immunity can be achieved and when. Was there difference in exposure rates to Covid-19 based on age? Juneja: In slums  there was not much difference across age groups and exposure. The hypothesis is there is a lot of intermingling of population in slum  that could be one reason. In non-slums we found young people were more exposed than senior citizens. But it is a small trend  we need more data. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

"The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted an increase in rainfall activity in Mumbai and adjoining areas from August 1. According to the district forecast warning  Mumbai is ‘very likely’ to receive “heavy rain at isolated places” from July 31 for three days. Heavy rain at isolated places is also likely in Palghar from August 1. Light to moderate showers were recorded between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. The IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded 9.4 mm rain in 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on Wednesday  whereas Colaba recorded heavy rain at 89 mm in the same time period.

"THE STATE government  responding to a plea filed by actor Pramod Pandey (70) seeking to quash and set aside restrictions on movement to shooting site  on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that its decision to bar cast and crew  including actors aged above 65 on sets of fiction or non-fiction programming  was not permanent and may change as per new unlock guidelines on July 31. Government Pleader Purnima H Kantharia told the High Court that the decision was not arbitrary or discriminatory  however it was in the interest of senior citizens. “There may be a change. We don’t know what changes may come up on August 1. As of today  it would not be an arbitrary decision as it is of temporary nature and taken in the interest of persons above 65 years old ” Kantharia said. A division bench of Justice S J Kathawalla and Justice R I Chagla heard the pleas challenging the restrictions and enquired from the state government whether these restrictions  as per guidelines dated May 31 and June 23  were prohibitory/mandatory or of advisory/recommendatory. Along with Pandey  Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IMPPA) also approached the HC against the restrictions. Justice Kathawalla asked the state government to clarify if the restrictions were mandatory and if it would attract consequences in the form of legal action if an artist aged above 65 is found to be in violation of the same.

"Sahiba (22) is trying to gather clothes  bags and her two-year-old son Noor  trying to protect them all from the rainwater leaking from a flyover near the Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. “We are living under this flyover  and he wants to go out – which means we walk around holding him ” said Sabiha pointing towards Noor. This January  Noor was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma  a rare cancer of the liver  setting off a chain of events that had turned the family from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh virtually into nomads  as they shuttle between their hometown and Mumbai  and between shelter homes and the flyover. This is the family’s third visit to Mumbai. In April  The Indian Express had reported how the family  along with other cancer patients  was shifted by the hospital from under the flyover into a Bandra shelter for the homeless. “This is our life now. I haven’t been able to work since January  our savings have run out ” said Noor’s father Zafar (24)  a construction worker. A senior oncologist in Jabalpur had referred Noor’s case to the Tata Memorial Hospital. On January 27  at Noor’s first OPD appointment at the hospital  it had dawned on Zafar that the treatment would be a long haul. “The doctors said he would need 10 cycles of chemotherapy at 15-day intervals. I didn’t even know what chemo was until then ” he said. “As the tumour grew  Noor would throw up everything he ate ” Sahiba recounted. Lacking resources for a prolonged stay  the couple returned home after the first chemo cycle in February  defaulting on the treatment for three weeks. “In the case of hepatoblastoma  not missing a (chemo) cycle is very important to stop the tumour from worsening ” said an oncologist  who is treating Noor at the hospital. The family would return to Mumbai in the first week of March  as Noor’s condition worsened. The cancer care shelter where they had stayed in January refused to take them back  forcing the poor family to camp on the street outside the hospital. “We saw other families living on the road and joined them ” Zafar said. They had never before lacked a roof over their head. Zafar’s mother and sister would join them mid-March. “The lockdown was the worst thing to happen to us. Suddenly  there were no food vendors and NGO activists couldn’t come often because of the travel curbs ” Zafar said. Living in the open also carried the danger of contracting the virus. The move to the Bandra shelter was a blessing  but the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) soon realised that housing immune-compromised cancer survivors along with other homeless persons could actually spell disaster during a contagious pandemic. They were then moved to a lodge that did not allow them to use a stove to make fresh meals for Noor  who was diagnosed as “severely malnourished” at 7.5 kg. Eventually  the family was moved to another private accommodation arranged by the hospital. For the next two months  as the family stayed on  their savings started running out. Their landlord in Jabalpur started threatening eviction. As Noor was an OPD patient  he was checked for Covid-19 before every chemo cycle. On May 27  Noor and his mother tested positive for the virus  which ledhospital itself  even as rest of the family continued to stay at the private accommodation. Noor had mild symptoms  delaying his chemo and undoing his recovery. By the time  Sahiba and Noor were discharged on June 10  he had completed only six chemo sessions  he needed four more before an operation. By then  their Jabalpur landlord was throwing their meagre furniture out. “We pay Rs 3 000 as rent. The government said rent would be deferred during the lockdown  but our landlord didn’t waive it ” said Sahiba. After the mother and son recovered from Covid-19  a new problem arose – the private accommodation refused to allow the two back. As they were in danger of losing their home in Jabalpur too  the family told the doctors that they were returning. The doctors packed two doses of chemo in an ice box  to be administered in Jabalpur. The 1 100-km journey back home was on a truck ferrying essentials. It cost Rs 2 000. When the doctor in Jabalpur asked them to come after quarantining themselves for 14 days  the family did not go back to her. The chemo kits lost their efficacy. On July 16  Noor’s birthday  the child threw up the whole day. Panicking  Zafar and Sahiba somehow managed to board a train to Mumbai with Noor  and are now back under the same flyover near the hospital. An NGO working for poor cancer-afflicted children and their families had offered the family stay  but on the condition that none of them could leave the premises  an option Zafar feels he no longer has. “I have to go out and find work. I have been jobless  running around for Noor since January. Even if we get food here  what about my mother and sister back home?” said Zafar. The family has found a lodge to stay in for the next couple of days but beyond that they cannot afford the Rs 500 per night charge. “I have spoken to some people for some renovation jobs  I need the money ” Zafar added. Noor’s treatment will cost over Rs 2 lakh and is being funded by a charitable organisation through the Tata Memorial Hospital. “Can you find me a job? I’ll do anything ” Zafar asked  desperately. “Or a place to stay ” he added. Just then  Sahiba’s phone rings. It is her mother-in-law. The landlord has started threatening again. ",mumbai,ie
"Two persons in the city were cheated of over Rs 6 lakh in the past 24 hours after fraudsters gained access to their computers through remote access software  the police said. According to the police  in one case  Amita Jamenis (38)  a Borivali resident  downloaded an app on Thursday to invest in mutual funds. There was some problem with e-verification of signature and she emailed customer service. She received a call from a person who claimed to be from the app’s customer service. The caller told her that e-verification could be completed online and asked her to download remote access software  the police said. The caller also sent her a link with a form attached. She was asked to fill details like debit card number. After she did  a series of transactions took place that led to Rs 3 lakh being withdrawn from her bank account. She then approached the police. The second case took place at Mahim in which a 48-year-old woman  Prafulla Bam  was cheated of Rs 3.08 lakh when a person claiming to be updating her PayTM KYC asked her to download remote access software over which he made fraudulent transactions  the police said. Remote access software allows file transfer or even repair or troubleshoot a device remotely and have gained popularity during the lockdown. The police said fraudsters are taking advantage of the situation. A police officer said a security measure in such apps asks the person who owns the device to enter a nine-digit access code after which the other person gets remote access to the device. “Unfortunately  as fraudsters manage to bypass the OTP security feature in ATM cards by convincing victims to disclose them  they manage to convince users to disclose remote access codes as well ” the officer said  adding that while victims do get suspicious to share OTP  they are not so while allowing access to their systems through remote software.

"Three persons  allegedly posing as employees of a Kenya-based firm  have been booked for cheating a surgical and medical equipment supplier from south Mumbai of Rs 1.3 crore under the pretext of providing one lakh face masks. The three booked have been identified as Peter Sen Klob  Dr James Mubbuya and David. According to the FIR was registered on Sunday  the 37-year-old supplier’s company was looking at procuring a variant of the N95 masks  called 3M N95  which are in short supply. He had issued an advertisement on April 24 on a business-to-business website seeking supply of these masks. The same day  he received an email from a man posing as the manager of a Kenya-based company  Global Investment Consortium (GIC)  said police. The man identified himself as Peter Sen Klob and said that 3M N95 masks were available with them. In his statement to the police  the complainant said  “We sent one person to the registered address of the company in Nairobi  who inspected the goods and got back saying that the masks were available in large numbers. The person even met the owner of the company  Dr James Mubbuya.” The complainant’s company and GIC struck a deal for one lakh face masks at Rs 1 36 67 766. The police said the fraudsters then asked the complainant to send the money to their Jammi Bora Bank Limited account  which was under the name of Amadi and Associates Advocates. However  as there was a problem in sending the amount to that account  the supplier was given another account number at the Co-operative Bank of Kenya. By 11 June  the company deposited 1.3 crore to the account  following which  Klob informed that they will deliver the face masks through a Air France flight. “The parcel was supposed to be dispatched on June 17 and delivered by June 20 ” said an officer from M R A Marg police station. However  on June 17  when the complainant reached out to Air France officials  he was informed that their flight was not carrying any such parcel. When the complainant tried to reach the three persons booked  their phones were found to be switched off. Assistant Inspector Ravindra Patil said  “As the parcel did not reach Mumbai  the complainant waited for a few days and then submitted a complaint application by June-end.

So far this month  the civic body has collected a daily average of 13 700 kg bio-medical waste from Covid care centres and hospitals  a steep fall from the daily average of 22 023 kg in June. Till date in July  BMC has collected a total of 1.92 lakh kg of bio-medical waste. Data with Solid Waste Management (SWM) department shows that June saw the city generating 6.60 lakh kg bio-medical waste  the highest since March when the Covid outbreak hit Mumbai  with a daily average of 22 023 kg (22 mt) as against the pre-pandemic daily average of 12 000 to 14 000 kg. Civic officials have attributed the decrease in bio-waste generation to the steadying numbers of Covid-19 cases in the city. BMC officials said that one of the reasons for this is the decreasing number of new Covid cases and patients at Covid care centres. At active Covid Care Centres (CCC2) across the city  where symptomatic patients are brought for isolation  67 per cent of 5 068 beds are vacant as of July 25. Comparatively  in the last week of May  CCC2 active facilities had 5 179 beds of which only 35 per cent of beds were vacant. “Since last one month we have seen a dip in Covid-19 cases and also daily  there is an average 1 000 to 1 200 cases. The recovery rate is more than 70 per cent and the doubling rate is 69 days so patients are less  because of which bio-medical waste generation has gone down ” said a BMC officer. Until July 27  Mumbai had reported 1.10 lakh Covid-19 cases and 6 129 deaths. There are 21 812 active cases in the city. But the number of daily cases has fallen in July as compared to June. In March  when the first case was reported in the city  3.48 lakh kg bio-medical waste was generated with an average of 11 230 kg daily. While in April it was 12 675 kg  in May it increased to 17 631 kg and June saw the biggest jump with 22 023 kg daily. For this month  until July 15  the daily average fell to 13 725 kg. SWM officials said bio-medical wastes include syringes  medicines  used masks  gloves  urine bags  body fluid or blood soaked tissues or cotton  PPEs used by staff working on Covid-19 duties. All of these Covid-19 waste is being collected in yellow bags with biohazard signs on them. “All bio-medical wastes from Covid care centres and hospitals are taken to a treatment plant near Deonar dumping ground. There  by incineration and autoclave it is disposed of. Also  non-Covid wastes from Covid care centres like food are buried deep in a separate area at Deonar dumping ground and sprayed with sodium hypochlorite ” said a senior officer from the SWM department. Earlier  civic body had faced problems in disposal of bio-medical waste as generation was higher than the plant’s capacity. The plant at Deonar which is being operated by SMS Envoclean has capacity of treating 15 metric tonne and after an increase in bio-waste generation civic officials had written to the firm to enhance the capacity. Currently  city is generating about 4 500 metric tonne waste daily. According to the data  about 82 metric tonne of bio-medical waste and municipal solid waste (MSW) are generated daily from Covid care centres and quarantine areas like sealed buildings and containment zones. Data shows that K-west ward (Andheri  Jogeshwari) and M-west (Chembur) ward generates a maximum of 9000 kg BMW and MSW each ward  following 6000 kg in P-north (Malad). ",mumbai,ie
"For the first time in over three months  only 7.9 per cent of those tested in Mumbai in a day were found to be Covid-19 positive. Mumbai on Tuesday saw 8 776 people being tested  the highest number of tests conducted in the city in a single day so far. Of these  only 700 – 7.9 per cent of those who were tested – were found to be infected. “Mumbai’s doubling rate (of cases) is now 68 days ” BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said. The city on Tuesday recorded 55 deaths due to Covid-19  taking its toll to 6 187. The total number of cases climbed to 1.10 lakh. The widening gap in the number of tests conducted and positive cases can be attributed to several factors. Senior BMC officials have pointed to a slower viral transmission pattern in the community. The liberalisation of the testing policy has also led to a dip in the positivity rates. Since July 3  BMC has allowed everyone to get tested without a doctor’s prescription  encouraging “testing at will”. With the scope of testing now broadened from targeted testing of symptomatic and high-risk contacts to the general population  experts believe the percentage of those testing positive has reduced.  A state health official  however  pointed out that 60 to 70 per cent of the tests conducted on Tuesday in Mumbai were antigen tests  which are known for less specificity and high sensitivity – meaning antigen tests may miss a positive case and diagnose it as negative. More antigen tests and less RT-PCR tests could also explain why positivity rate is dipping in the city. On Tuesday  Worli MLA Aaditya Thackeray tweeted: “Mumbai will see more testing with chase the virus initiative of BMC. It is also the only city to have liberalised testing and allowed citizens to ‘test at will’.” He added that the ‘chase the virus’ policy is being implemented in Mumbai Metropolitan Region  after noting the outcomes in Mumbai. Data of BMC testing numbers shows as on July 1  of the 6 044 samples examined  1 554 people (25.7 per cent) tested positive. The positivity rate fell to 22.1 per cent on July 10  and further down to 20.6 per cent on July 20. On July 25  it stood at 13.1 per cent. Overall  Mumbai’s positivity rate stands at 22.4 per cent now. In Sion hospital laboratory  officials said that in April and May  their lab would find 60 to 70 per cent of samples testing positive  which has slowly reduced to 30 to 40 per cent by June. BMC Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said high-risk population was moved to quarantine centres to break the viral chain. “This has yielded results. Our strategy in slums  where the transmission was high  specially in Worli and Dharavi  was to isolate high-risk people. Measures like hand hygiene and masks have also slowed transmission ” he added. Following the sero survey results of BMC  research scientist Dr Gagandeep Kang said  “At 57 per cent  we are close to herd immunity. Cases in Mumbai slums might have dipped because most people in crowded localities were already infected.”  ",mumbai,ie
"The failure to meet pollution level guidelines set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) could mean that those living in suburban Mumbai may see their life spans shortened by three-and-a-half years  while those in Mumbai City may lose three years and one month of their lives. These warnings are derived from the data released by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI)  a tool developed by the Energy Policy Institute at The University of Chicago  on Tuesday. If the residents are exposed to PM 2.5 levels that breach WHO guidelines  for people living of Pune  it is a loss of three years and four months  followed by Kolhapur (two years and four months)  Nagpur (three and a half years) and Nashik (three years). While the WHO guideline is 10 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3)  the national standard for India is 40 µg/m3 for PM 2.5. AQLI  which converts particulate air pollution to its impact on life expectancy  said such pollution in India has risen a sharp 42 per cent over the last two decades  and was the greatest risk to human health before Covid-19 struck. The research team had conducted an air quality analysis of various cities from 1998 till 2018. The findings were combined with localised and global particulate measurements. Currently  84 per cent of the population lives in areas where pollution levels exceed even India-set air quality standards  the report said. The AQLI measured potential gains in life expectancy by lowering PM 2.5 concentrations to meet either the WHO guidelines for particulate matter concentrations or the national standards. The average PM 2.5 levels in Mumbai suburbs in 2018 was 45.7 µg/m3. In 2019  the National Clean Air Programme was launched with a target of 20 to 30 per cent reduction in PM 2.5 (fine  respirable pollution particles) and PM 10 (coarse pollution particles) concentration in 102 non-attainment cities (cities that did not meet the annual PM 10 national standard from 2011 to 2015) by 2024. A nationwide reduction of 25 per cent would increase India’s national life expectancy by one year and six months  and by three years and one month for residents of Delhi  the report stated.

"District Collector Naval Kishore Ram on Thursday said the collectorate will be forced to take action against hospitals which do not help patients seeking treatment. The district collector said he has been getting complaints that private hospitals as well as the civic-run YCM hospital were turning away patients without guiding or directing them to hospitals where beds are available. “I had said earlier also that patients should first inquire with Sassoon or YCM hospitals. If these two hospitals do not have beds available  it is the duty of these hospitals to help the patient and his relatives find a hospital where a bed is available. The patient and their families should not be made to run from pillar to post. Otherwise  I will have to take action against the officials of the government and civic hospitals ” said the district collector. On Wednesday  51-year-old Kutubuddin Shaikh of Aundh Road had complained to the district collector that he and his family members had to visit more than 10 hospitals in both Pune city and Pimpri-Chinchwad in search of a ventilator bed. Amir Mulani  a resident of Akurdi  said his 63-year-old father passed away while waiting for a ventilator bed in YCM Hospital last week. “The hospital kept telling me that it will provide plasma therapy to my father once they get a vacant bed. In the meantime  I also called up a few other hospitals but all of them said they cannot help as they had no ventilator beds available ” said Mulani  who has also lodged a complaint with the collectorate. Dr Rajendra Wable  dean of YCM Hospital and Medical College  said  “We are hard pressed to look after the admitted patients as well as handle the constant flow of patients at the hospital. We do not have a system in place where we can guide the patients and their relatives to find a hospital and ventilator bed. The patients’ relatives have to themselves find another hospital…we do not have enough manpower…”. The district collector  however  said the YCM Hospital administration was duty-bound to set up a system to guide the patients and their relatives. He said he will take up the issue with Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar. ",pune,ie

On July 1  the number of positive cases in Maharashtra Police was 4 900 and only 60 fatalities were reported till then. Since then  as many as 4 100 cases and 40 deaths have been reported in the state police force. Many police stations and various branches from jurisdictions across the state have been impacted by severe staff crunch after cases were detected among police staff and the affected personnel and their close contacts  including colleagues  were hospitalised and isolated.
The major portion of the total cases in Maharashtra Police have been among local police personnel in Mumbai  its surrounding areas and personnel of Maharashtra SRPF deployed in high risk areas who were later repatriated to their home units. Besides Mumbai and the SRPF  cases have continued to rise among the Nashik Rural  Thane City  Pune City  Navi Mumbai  Mumbai Railway and Solapur police forces.
Since the lockdown in March  there have been 323 cases of assault on on-duty police officers who were part of enforcement deployments across the state.

"The KEM Hospital and Research Centre at Vadu  20 km from Pune  is planning to conduct a sentinel sero-surveillance to monitor the trend of SARS-nCoV-2 infection transmission in the general population in rural western India. “The purpose of our study is to generate information about the extent of Covid-19 spread in the community  which is currently lacking in India. The development of antibodies is a sign of exposure to Covid-19 infection and is believed to render immunity ” Dr Sanjay Juvekar  principal investigator of the study  told The Indian Express. The study is being funded by the RESPIRE unit of the University of Edinburgh along with Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI). The RESPIRE unit is a global health research unit focusing on respiratory health in Asia. Dr Ashish Bawdekar  co-investigator of the study  said they were looking at a sample size of 11 000 people. The study will be carried out in three age groups: 1 to 17 years  18 to 50 years and older than 51 years. This study is likely to help us understand the extent of transmission in different age groups and both genders of the population and the rate at which new cases are occurring over time  the authors said. Dr Sanjay Mehendale  former additional director general of Indian Council of Medical Research  and presently director  research at P D Hinduja Hospital and Medical Research Centre  was instrumental in conceptualising the study. Researchers plan to take 2 to 3 ml of blood samples to test them for presence of antibodies against Covid-19. The interview and blood collection procedure will take 20 minutes and the survey will commence next week. At least five rounds will be conducted and in each round  2 700 individuals will be enrolled. THSTI will test the samples. According to study researchers  the survey and laboratory tests will inform people about the precautionary measures to be taken to save their family members  colleagues and friends from getting infected. Adar Poonawalla  CEO of Serum Institute of India (SII)  said they had submitted details of the proposed clinical trials for a Covid-19 vaccine to the DCGI a few days ago. While he refused to comment on the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) asking SII to submit a revised protocol to perform clinical trials for a potential Covid-19 vaccine in India  Poonawalla said they were sure to get the approvals within a week. The CDSCO’s subject expert committee had sought additional information about the protocol for phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The SII has partnered with AstraZeneca for manufacturing the Oxford vaccine candidate for Covid-19  ‘Covishield’. The randomised controlled study will enrol at least 1 600 participants to determine the safety and immunogenicity of Covishield.

"Police have detained a 17-year-old family member over the murder of a 17-year-old girl in Khed near Pune. The teenager is suspected to have killed the girl as she used to make fun of him over his “feminine features” and the female roles played by him in folk art performances  said police. Police said the suspect was even part of the search party formed to look for the girl after she had gone missing. Police had earlier arrested three other persons in the case  based on a complaint filed by the victim’s family members. But now  police have said that their probe has revealed that the three persons were not involved in the murder  and their discharge from the case will be sought from the court. The girl  who belongs to a farmer family  had gone missing from her house on July 23. Her body was found at a secluded spot near a canal the following day. The family members of the girl filed a complaint with the police  naming three persons from the village who had allegedly harassed her a few months ago. While police arrested the trio for murder based on the complaint  probe teams kept investigating other angles. “Our teams continued meticulous analysis of technical leads and also kept a close watch on persons known to the girl. We kept looking for odd behaviour by anyone or versions with missing links given by people whom we were speaking to. The situation in the village had become sensitive  because local residents were named in the murder ” said the inspector probing the case. During the probe  police found that a 17-year-old relative of the girl  who is her cousin’s son  had gone to the family of the girl and informed them about her death when others were still ascertaining the details. Probe teams zeroed in on the youth and further probe confirmed his involvement in the crime. After police detained him for questioning  he confessed to the crime  said officials. Police probe has now revealed that the suspect portrays a woman’s character in folk art performances  and the girl used to make fun of him because of this. “He has told us that he planned to kill her and decided on a modus operandi to destroy evidence  based on what he has seen in crime TV shows and movies. On the day of the murder  he kept speaking to the girl on the phone  asking her where she is  when she was near the secluded spot near the canal. Later  he was also part of the search party that was formed by villagers and family members to look for the girl ” said the inspector. He added  “The 17-year-old has been booked for murder.

The family of the patient  who had symptoms of Covid-19 including fever  cough  fatigue and breathlessness  ran from pillar to post but were turned away from several private hospitals  which claimed that they had no ventilator bed available in ICU. In a letter sent to District Collector Naval Kishore Ram on Wednesday  51-year Kutubuddin Shaikh  an engineer  has demanded a probe into his plight. “I was a suspected Covid-19 patient when my family went looking for beds in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad hospitals.

The district collector should put the facts before Pune residents on whether there is a shortage of oxygenated beds or ventilator beds… I want the collector to order a probe ” stated Shaikh in the letter. Ram said he will order an investigation as to why Shaikh was turned away from so many hospitals. “This should not have happened. We need to probe this thoroughly and set up an effective mechanism ” he said. While Shaikh initially tested negative for Covid-19 on July 13  he tested positive two days later. Shaikh  a diabetic  said he had fever and cough for two to three days and was recieving treatment at a local clinic in Aundh. “My family took me to the PMC hospital in Bopodi on July 13  where they apparently conducted a rapid antigen test on me.

My elder brother and my nephew then took me to Makan Hospital  Aundh  in the night… the doctors said… sorry we can’t do anything  you please go to Medipoint Hospital  Aundh.” We went to Medipoint Hospital. As usual  the doctors asked me my symptoms… they took my chest X-ray. After that they told me… sorry  we cannot admit you. From there  my elder brother  my nephew and other relatives decided that we will go to D Y Patil Hospital  Pimpri  which was at least eight km away. … That night  my family members were praying for me  right from small children to the elderly. My younger brother’s family friend  advocate Sushil Mancharkar  was constantly in touch with us throughout the night and was trying very hard to get a ventilator bed for me by contacting his sources and hospitals.” Shaikh’s younger brother Sameer said ”At D Y Patil Hospital  Pimpri  the doctors were very supportive. They admitted my brother in the casualty ward and put him on oxygen support. They told me that my brother needed a ventilator bed and I should look for a facility with one. That night  I went to several hospitals such as Aditya Birla  Niramaye Kavade Nursing Home and Star Hospital  Akurdi. I must have gone to 10 hospitals. At each hospital  I was told there were no ventilator beds available. ” According to him  the next day morning  doctors at D Y Patil Hospital said they can’t admit Shaikh  who needed ventilator support and high-flow oxygen as he couldn’t breathe on his own. Dr Hanumant Chavan  medical superintendent of D Y Patil Hospital  said ”It is a fact that we do not have vacant ventilator beds in ICU. Our ICU is constantly full. This is the condition in every hospital in Pune…the hospitals can’t be blamed for turning away patients for non-availability of ventilator beds.” The Shaikh family then got to know about an available bed in Jehnagir Hospital ICU. “From D Y Patil Hospital to Jehangir Hospital  we travelled for nearly 15 km. Much to our shock  the doctor there told us that they don’t have any ventilator beds available. From Jehangir  we came back to Lokmanya Hospital in Chinchwad  more than 15 km away. Here too  the same story was repeated. At Lokmanya Hospital  my brother’s condition worsened. He fell unconscious…this terrified me. ” Shaikh told The Indian Express ”The whole night I had not eaten anything and was only on water. I had no strength. I had high fever  cough and was finding it difficult to breathe. The continuous travelling took a toll on me and I collapsed at Lokmanya Hospital…”. By the afternoon of July 14  Sameer said ”Yogesh Pillay  a hockey player and friend  contacted Ruby Hall Clinic. At 6 pm  my brother was admitted to Ruby Hall’s casualty ward and then shifted to ICU in the night.” Shaikh tested postive for Covid-19 on July 15. “I was in the ICU for one week  I had pnuemonia and was discharged last Friday…. Thanks to my relatives  friends  my company and thanks to Allah. This is really a second life for me.” “I would like to bring to the notice of the district collector that the conditions in hospitals are horrible  patients are dying because of lack of proper medical facilities  there is no planning  no adequate number of ventilator or oxygen beds. We keep hearing that there are adequate ventilators and oxygen beds but this is not true… ” he added. Shaikh told The Indian Express  “During this difficult time  I learnt that a patient should not delay seeking proper treatment. The moment we start showing symptoms  we should consult doctors in a major hospital.” ",pune,ie
"An elderly couple were found dead in their apartment in Karve Nagar area of Pune on Monday afternoon when the housemaid went to their home to deliver the tiffin. Preliminary probe into the death suggested that the husband allegedly killed the wife and later ended life by hanging as a fallout to both of their prolonged illnesses. The housemaid was the first to inform the family members of the couple  who later informed the police. While husband-Avinash Hemant Gore (70) was found hanging with a dupatta  wife-Vaishali (66) was found lying unresponsive. Both were subsequently declared dead. Deputy Commissioner of Police Pornima Gaikwad said  “we have found a note in the house which says that they were ending their lives because of their prolonged illness.

"WITH the collective case count crossing the 18 000 mark and demand for oxygenated and ventilator beds rising  the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has decided to set up two additional facilities  which will double its own oxygenated bed capacity. This will come as a major relief for residents of Pimpri-Chinchwad as YCM Hospital  the biggest dedicated Covid hospital here  has been turning away serious patients due to non-availability of vacant oxygenated and ventilator beds in its ICU for the last 50 days. As of now  PCMC has 500 oxygenated beds at YCM  Bhosari and Jijamata hospitals. Of these  YCM Hospital has 350 oxygenated beds. “Our oxygenated bed capacity will be doubled by August 10. We plan to set up dedicated Covid health centres at two places. One will be at Balnagari in Indrayaninagar area and another will be at Auto Cluster in Chinchwad ” Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar said on Tuesday. Dr Rajendra Wable  dean of YCM Hospital and Medical College  said  “The hospital has 350 oxgenated beds and 50 functional ventilator beds in the ICU. In the last one-and-a-half months  we have been running at full capacity. We haven’t had a single vacant oxygenated bed or ventilator bed in ICU. Though we want to admit each and every patient who turns up at the hospital  we can’t do so…”. Hardikar said 30 more ventilator beds in the ICU will soon become functional at YCMH . “Besides  we have 22 ICU beds at our hospitals at Bhosari and Jijamata  which will become functional. Seventy ventilator beds are coming up at Auto Cluster  which will increase our ventilator bed capacity also ” he said. PCMC health chief Dr Anil Roy  whose team monitors the dash board in the civic body’s ‘war room’  said  “As of 9 pm on Tuesday  not a single ventilator bed was available in private hospitals or YCMH Hospital. In 41 private hospitals  which have 52 ventilator beds  no bed is vacant. In YCMH  all 50 ventilator beds are occupied. However  it has also been observed that private hospitals do not update their bed availability regularly. We have given training to their staff  still the problem continues ” he said. Meanwhile  the PCMC commissioner has appointed two IRS officers  N Ashok Babu and Ravindra Chavan  to check the bed management and medical bills of private hospitals.

"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Pune city within a couple of days to take stock of the Covid-19 response so far and future preparations by the district administration to tackle the infection  Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said at a video-conference meeting held in Mumbai with Union minister Prakash Javadekar. The Covid-19 response in Pune is being supervised by Pawar  who is the guardian minister of the district. Thackeray has not visited Pune since he became the chief minister of Maharashtra in November last year. Members of opposition parties  including BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole  have accused Thackeray of not paying attention to the city  which is among the worst-affected in the country by the Covid-19 crisis. At the meeting  Pawar informed Javadekar about the steps being taken in Pune to control the spread of coronavirus. He also told Javadekar that the Covid control work in Pune will be undertaken under a central command to ensure better co-ordination. “The increase in the number of patients in Pune district is a result of huge increase in testing. The situation in Pune is under control… all the state government and district administration agencies are working on war footing to control the spread of the virus. The bed capacity in the district has been increased to a great extent and three jumbo facilities  which are being created  will add to the capacity ” said Pawar. “Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Pune in the next two days and it will further boost the fight against Covid-19 ” said Pawar. The meeting was attended by Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol  State Health Minister Rajesh Tope  Principal Secretary Pradeep Vyas  Pune Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar  Officer on Special Duty Saurabh Rao  Pune Collector Naval Kishore Ram  PMC Commissioner Vikram Kumar and PCMC Commissioner Shravan Hardikar  among others. Following a request from Tope  Javadekar promised to try to procure medical staff and equipment from defence institutions based in Pune such as Command Hospitals and the Armed Forces Medical College. The Centre has decided to provide 100 ventilators to the civic body for the treatment of critical patients  and also urged it to take the help of State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) to implement strict restrictions on the movement of public in containment zones  said Mohol after the meeting. Mohol said Javadekar was provided detailed information on the current situation in the city and measures taken to control the spread of infection. The Mayor said the state government has decided to contribute 50 per cent of the expenditure for setting up ‘jumbo’ Covid care facilities in the city  while the PMC will incur 25 per cent of the remaining cost  PCMC will bear 12.5 per cent and PMRDA will bear 12.5 per cent. “I welcome the state government’s contribution… However  the state government should also provide financial support to the civic body  considering its present financial situation ” said Mohol. The lockdown has badly hit the various streams of revenue generation of the PMC  which was already facing a financial crisis before the pandemic. ",pune,ie
"As many as 200 nurses of Jehangir Hospital  who had boycotted work since Sunday to demand better pay  resumed their duty on Wednesday  said hospital authorities. “We have assured salary increments during the next appraisal cycle ” Vinod Sawantwadkar  CEO of Jehangir Hospital  told The Indian Express. “We have restored our services… during the two days  we were unable to take in more admissions. However  the hospital has nearly 145 Covid positive patients and they are recovering well ” said Sawantwadkar  adding  “We have been listening to them  talking to them and understanding their concerns as a team”. The nurses had boycotted work to protest long working hours and low salaries. Matthew John  joint secretary of the United Nurses Association  which had supported the boycott  said that a day-long meeting was held  where authorities and nurses discussed various issues. Hospital authorities have informed them that due to the Covid-19 crisis  raising nurses’ salaries will take some time  said John. The authorities have also agreed to give PPE kits  reduce daily working hours from 12 to six  and grant a rest period for nurses. ",pune,ie
"A number of private hospitals are facing shortage of nurses  an issue that the authorities took up at a meeting called by the divisional commissioner’s office on Tuesday. Hospital authorities said some nurses had quit either for better opportunities in Middle East countries or left to join short three-month contract jobs at government medical facilities. They further said some had also stopped reporting to work due to the Covid-19 outbreak. At Noble hospital in Hadapsar  80 nurses left in the last two months. An analysis shows that half of them preferred to leave for Middle East countries  while some returned to their native places – mostly Kerala – and others opted for short-term jobs with government hospitals that offered better salaries. “Traditionally  nurses – mainly from Kerala – prefer to gain experience for two to three years at NABH-accredited (National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers) hospitals before applying for better opportunities in the Middle East and OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries. For us  however  we are already reeling from a shortage of manpower and it is unfortunate that 70 to 80 nurses had to leave in the last two months ” said Dr H K Sale  executive director of Noble hospital  which has treated over 1 000 Covid-19 patients. Dr Sale added that before a countrywide lockdown was imposed  the hospital had 420 nurses  and was now left with 315. According to Tritpi Nanda  chief nursing officer at Noble hospital  opportunities have opened up in the Middle East and nurses are getting offer letters immediately after online interviews. “The analysis also shows that nurses left because of the fear factor (of Covid-19) as their parents asked them to return home. Sometimes  nurses just stopped reporting to work while some opted for short-term government jobs ” Nanda said. For instance  25-year-old Annmary Tomy has been working as a staff nurse at the intensive care unit (ICU) of Noble hospital for three and a half years. “I attended an online interview and answered questions on how to care for a ventilated patient or manage a post-op cardiac patient in the ICU. They selected me and have sent an offer letter with a salary of approximately Rs 1 lakh and accommodation. I am required to join Almoosa Specialist Hospital in Saudi Arabia by the second week of September ” Tomy said. A 24-year-old staff nurse  also working at the ICU in Noble hospital  said she got an offer letter from a hospital in Oman and is all set to leave next month. “I will go to my hometown in Kollam (Kerala) as I have not met my parents for two years. Also  I will have to stay in quarantine for 14 days  after which I will be free to leave the country ” she said. “It is a known fact that most junior nurses  mainly from Kerala  who come to the city to get two to three years of experience from NABH-accredited hospitals  scout for better opportunities in the Middle East and at least 20 from each hospital leave every year between May and July. Apart from the panic and fear caused by the Covid-19 crisis  shortage is also being felt as final-year exams of nursing colleges have not been held and a fresh batch has not yet come to hospitals ” said Dr Sanjay Lalwani  medical director of Bharati hospital  who has seen more than 150 nurses leave in the last few months. At Poona hospital  at least 100 nurses have left ever since Covid-19 cases started rising. The management had to shut down some departments to ensure that other patients are cared for. “One nurse for one ICU patient is just not possible and even if oxygenated beds are provided there is no staff to manage patients. We are short of 80 to 90 nurses ” said Dr J Ravindranath  director of Poona hospital. Bomi Bhote  president of Hospital Association of Pune  along with several other owners/directors of other hospitals said a central team of officers headed by Kunal Kumar was also present at the meeting with the divisional commissioner  where they spoke about issues faced by hospitals. “Buildings  beds  and equipment are important but what makes a hospital is the staff strength – doctors  nurses  ward assistants – and there is an increasing shortage as most of those who are in contact with Covid-19 patients have to stay in quarantine for some days and then return to work ” Bhote said  adding that they needed 50 per cent more staff than available now Bhote added that junior consultants were pitching in  but hospitals were desperately looking for staff. Dr Anjali Sabne  Assistant Medical Officer  PMC  said 45 trained nurses had joined duty for a period of six months and the approximate salary structure started from Rs 30 000 to Rs 35 000. According to Pune Zilla Parishad authorities  at least 150 nurses had been recruited for a period of six months. ",pune,ie
"To get more private medical practitioners to join the anti-Covid fight  the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Tuesday decided to incur the medical expenditure of private medical staff involved in treating Covid-19 patients and provide them term insurance of Rs 50 lakh. “It has been noticed that private medical practitioners at their clinics have stopped providing service…This has put pressure on the existing health infrastructure being utilised for treating patients ” said Municipal Commissioner Vikram Kumar. It is the duty of all private medical practitioners to serve the public during the pandemic  he said  adding that the PMC had held discussions with various associations of private medical practitioners to understand their issues and find a solution. “The PMC has decided to incur the treatment expenditure of private medical practitioners if they are infected while treating Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. The civic body will also provide them term insurance of Rs 50 lakh along the lines provided to Covid warriors ” said Hemant Rasane  chairperson of the PMC standing committee after the civic panel approved the administration’s proposal on Tuesday. He said the PMC will also provide necessary protective equipment to private medical practitioners at their respective clinics. “The civic administration has allowed private medical practitioners to treat asymptomatic or mild-symptom Covid-19 patients in home quarantine ” Rasane said  adding that this will help reduce pressure on the civic health infrastructure. The PMC also decided to implement the Critical Patient Management system to digitally track the health of critical patients at Covid hospitals in the city. Indohealth Software Solutions Pvt Ltd has been given the responsibility of implementing the system on real-time information for one year. “Details like symptoms and line of treatment would be keyed into the software and will help in immediate and effective treatment of patients  helping reduce case fatality rate ” said Kumar. The PMC also decided to sign an agreement with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General Hospital to avail its facility of 50 isolation beds with oxygen and 10 ICU beds with ventilators for patients referred by the civic administration. The PMC will pay the hospital Rs 50 lakh per month for six months. ",pune,ie

"Even as Pune became the city with the highest number of daily active Covid-19 cases in India in the last few days  the Nagar Road-Vadgaonsheri ward office area has recorded the highest growth rate of fresh cases in the last two weeks  while Dhole-Patil ward office  one of the worst-hit areas  recorded the slowest spread during the same time period. In the growth analysis of daily Covid-19 cases in 15 ward offices  Nagar Road-Vadgaonsheri ward office area has the fourth lowest of 2 269 patients registered so far  but a surge in new patients in the last two weeks made it the fourth highest with active cases at 968. It saw a growth of 94.2 per cent  40.1 per cent in the last week from July 20 to 26 and 54.1 per cent between July 13 and 19. This is the highest growth rate in any ward office area in the last two weeks.

Last week  the civic body declared 87 micro-containment zones by adding 23 new areas and deleting 45 from the earlier list of 109 micro-containment zones. Containment zones are sealed so that there is no movement  while there are restrictions in operating commercial establishments except those providing essential and emergency services. “Containment zones have to be redefined in a manner that they are neither too small nor too big.

However  the goal is now to assess property losses in accordance with the socioeconomic conditions of people ” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra  director general  India Meteorological Department (IMD). He was speaking at a webinar on ‘Cyclones and Storm Surges’  organised by the National Institute of Disaster Management on Tuesday.

S N Pradhan  director-general  National Disaster Response Force (NDRF)  said  “Certain structural damage repeatedly occurs after cyclones and our focus must now shift to protecting infrastructure. Besides  the community response to disasters like cyclones needs to be cultivated through greater awareness at local levels. The community response to Cyclone Fani in Odisha was different from the one to Cyclone Amphan in West Bengal.” Cyclone Fani had hit Puri in Odisha in May 2019 whereas Super Cyclone Amphan made landfall over the Sundarbans in West Bengal in May this year.

"After three alleged attacks on doctors and nurses at civic-run YCM Hospital  a dedicated Covid hospital in Pimpri  the medical staff at the hospital staged demonstrations on Monday  demanding stringent security measures. The PCMC administration also directed filing of an FIR against a corporator and action against patients’ relatives who allegedly created ruckus at the hospital after death of the patients. Nearly 100 doctors held the protest for nearly three hours. They said only off-duty doctors held demonstrations and medical services at the hospital were not affected. In a span of less than 24 hours on Sunday  doctors and nurses were allegedly abused and threatened thrice. The first two of the three incidents occurred on Sunday morning and in the afternoon. In the first incident  the medical staff had to lock themselves up in a room to escape the mob’s fury. The third incident took place at around 11 pm  when BJP corporator Sandeep Waghere from Pimprigaon reached the hospital and allegedly had a verbal argument with the doctors on duty. The doctors alleged that he also tried to beat them up  but they fled the spot. When contacted  Waghere said he had an argument with doctors over the death of an elderly citizen due to their “negligence”. But he denied that he either abused or tried to beat up the doctors. “The entire day  I was in touch with the doctors  requesting them to provide an ICU bed for a patient from my ward. I had also made plasma available to them for the patient. They kept promising that they will provide ICU facility  but did not do so ” said the corporator. However  Waghere said when he reached the hospital ward around 11 pm  he found the patient lying motionless. “I asked the doctor  they said they will shift the patient to the ICU in the next 10 minutes. However  other patients in the ward said the elderly patient had passed away an hour ago… This showed that the doctors were not even aware of the condition of the patient. After this  I had an argument with the doctors on duty. I did not beat them up or use foul language. I have video recording of the incident  I will prove it ” he said. Stating that these incidents have shaken the confidence of the medical staff  Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar said  “I have directed the YCMH administration to file an FIR against the corporator and all those who tried to attack the medical staff on Sunday. Stringent action is being taken to ensure that there is no repeat of such incidents in the future.” The PCMC chief said the civic administration will step up security at YCM Hospital with the help of police and private agencies. “We will appoint additional security personnel and will also try to get extra police reinforcement. We plan to place bouncers on every floor of the hospital ” said Hardikar. “…It has also been decided to set up a helpline centre at the War Room at PCMC headquarters  to answer queries relating to patients from relatives… whether local residents or corporators  they should all contact the helpline to get an update about the health of their patients at civic hospitals ” he said. Ajit Mane  president of the YCMH unit of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD)  in a statement  condemned the attack on the doctors and urged the PCMC administration to ensure proper security for the medical staff and resolve other grievances. “… All resident doctors are working as frontline Covid warriors and treating patients tirelessly. In the last four months  there have been repeated incidents of doctors being threatened and mentally tortured by patients’ relatives. In less than 24 hours  three such incidents happened. Despite informing the concerned authorities in the past  no firm action has been taken. We strongly condemn such incidents. We request the PCMC and the YCMH administration to take necessary steps for the security of the doctors  nurses and other hospital staff ” stated the Association. Dr Rajendra Wable  dean of YCMH  said  “We have given a complaint to the police. They said they will investigate and then lodge an FIR.” ",pune,ie
"EVEN AS the mortality rate of Covid-19 patients continues to drop in PMC limits and inches close to that of the country’s  residents of the city gave a push to the civic body’s effort to identify maximum cases through more determined testing with close to 12 per cent patients reporting to Covid centres of their own accord. Since the outbreak of Covid-19  the focus was on identifying cases with travel history from infected countries. Residents were made to stay in home quarantine for at least 14 days  as the administration concentrated on contact tracing along with a survey through mobile ambulance  home survey  and setting up flu clinics across the city. “Maximum 81.2 per cent patients were identified through contact tracing  while awareness raised by the civic body helped 11.6 per cent patients report their symptoms on their own ” said Mayor Murlidhar Mohol. The mortality rate in the PMC is 2.43 per cent  as compared to the country’s 2.29 per cent  the state’s 3.63 per cent  and 5.58 per cent in Mumbai. “Aggressive testing has helped identify patients at an early stage and isolate them for treatment and further check the spread of the infection ” Mohol said. As of July 25  5 460 patients were recorded to have reported for testing on their own. “The large number of persons reporting for testing on their own is helping the civic administration to identify patients  seeing that the civic body is already overburdened with the responsibility of finding patients from among 40 lakh people ” said a civic officer. The officer said the PMC had started many initiatives to identify patients  apart from contact tracing  and self-reporting was a sign of increasing awareness among residents. The PMC has also decided to further intensify public awareness efforts so that the fear around the disease could reduce and contribute in handling the pandemic more effectively  the officer added. The PMC has decided to undertake public awareness campaign on Covid-19 through social media  television  radio  print  and display boards. The civic body has set up numerous centres for rapid antigen testing to provide easy access to suspected cases  so that they can get themselves tested. The PMC has recorded a total number of 48 057 positive cases as on July 26  out of which 28 593 patients have recovered and been discharged. The death toll has climed to 1 166  while 682 are critical. The increasing number of critical patients has become a cause of concern as the PMC is facing shortage of relevant beds. Many critical patients from other districts are also getting admitted to city hospitals. The authorities have made hospitals discharge patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms and advise them home quarantine to make way for critical patients. As many as 8 394 out of 18 298 active cases are in home quarantine  while the remaining are in different Covid care centres across the city. ",pune,ie

While the administration is hopeful about a dip in the number of cases in the second half of August  it is also preparing for the ‘worst case scenario’. “There are various projections being made but if we go by the findings of the serological surveys for antibodies done in Delhi and Mumbai  and apply them to other cities  there is some hope that the numbers will go down post August 15 in Pune ” said Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar. “The projected estimates vary but in the worst case scenario  we expect nearly 46 000 active cases in PMC  15 000 in PCMC  4 000 in rural and over 1 500 in cantonments by August end and are preparing to face these challenges ” said Mhaisekar. “Till July 31  there will be an estimated 27 000 active cases ” said Additional Municipal Commissioner of PMC  Rubal Agarwal  adding that even if projections indicate a total of one lakh cases by August 20  at least 30 per cent patients will be from outside the city. Meanwhile  ramping up bed strength has enabled the administration to add 1 107 oxygenated beds and  as against 2 216 10 days ago  there are a total of 3 323 oxygenated beds  and 171 more ICU beds with ventilators. “There are a total of 24 194 beds that are available without oxygen ” said Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar. “While the number of cases is going to rise  the administration is finding solutions to handle them ” said District Collector Naval Kishore Ram. He said the positivity rate has risen from 20 to 25 per cent as the number of samples being tested is high in addition to contact tracing being taken up. According to Saurabh Rao  officer on special duty in the divisional commissioner’s office  the main issue is the availability of beds  and hence government facilities are also being upgraded. Agarwal  meanwhile  said rapid antigen tests have helped the PMC identify more Covid-19 patients and 40 931 tests through rapid antigen have been carried out so far  and 8 363 positive cases have been detected. “We hope to keep up the pace of testing and identify the infected persons for isolation  and in turn check the spread ” she said. As bed management was a priority  the PMC officer said the centralised bed management system has become functional with real-time updates via a software. “Few hospitals have already started using the software and in a week  all of them will use the software. This will not only help in locating available beds  but also track the line of treatment given to the particular patient and the medical staff treating the patient ” she said. Feasibility study before converting small nursing homes for Covid duty Saurabh Rao  officer on special duty in the divisional commissioner’s office  said the administration will set up an infrastructure task force and conduct a feasibility survey to ascertain how many small nursing homes  those with less than 50 beds  can be added to the Covid network of hospitals and nursing homes. “We had detailed discussions with IMA  General Practitioners Association and others. At GPA  more than 600 practitioners have offered to work at private and government facilities while the nursing bureau has also offered their nurses and other staff ” he said. ",pune,ie
"India is reporting less severe coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases  said Union health minister Harsh Vardhan during the 19th group of ministers’ (GoM) meeting held on Friday  as only 0.28% of patients are being currently on ventilator support across the country.  “Out of the total active cases  only 0.28% of patients are on ventilator support  1.61% patients on intensive care unit (ICU) support  and 2.32% are on oxygen support ” the minister said.  India’s case recovery rate is also improving steadily  and with over one million recoveries the current national recovery rate is 64.54%  he cited.  Delhi has recorded the highest recovery rate at 89.08%  followed by Haryana (79.82%). Karnataka has the lowest recovery rate at 39.36%.  “…this shows that the active cases under medical supervision are 33.27%  or approximately one-third of total Covid-19 positive cases. India’s case fatality rate (CFR) is also progressively reducing and currently stands at 2.18%  one of the lowest globally ” said the health minister.  The government aims to reduce the CFR further and bring down the national average to 1% or below.  The government is laying emphasis on reducing mortality in high-case load districts/ cities  and cities showing recent upsurge such as Pune  Thane  Bengaluru  and Hyderabad  etc.  The GoM also reviewed the distribution of confirmed Covid-19 cases along with locality and active cases in the containment zones across rural and urban India.  It has been found that the maximum caseload  which was about 80% of the cases  is restricted to 50 out of about 740 districts in the country.  In moderate caseload districts/cities  the efforts are on to focus on preventing spill-over from the high-burden areas; limiting local spread; early identification of cases; strengthening contact tracing with the use of technology; and community involvement.  In low-burden districts  the efforts are aimed at preventing infection among the population from other areas; strengthening influenza-like illness (ILI)/severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance and targeted testing; rigorous contact tracing with targets to be set by the local administration such as 15-20 contacts for every Covid-19 patient and prior identification of the high-risk population.  “This three-pronged strategy will help in controlling the disease spread. However  our main concern should be protecting the areas  where no Covid-19 cases are being reported  and also ensuring there is no increase in caseload in low disease-burden areas. The key is to strengthen community engagement  as it will help in sending the message across effectively ” said Jugal Kishore  head  community medicine  Safdarjung Hospital.  On the rapidly expanding testing capacity of India  Harsh Vardhan highlighted that to date  through a network of 1 331 laboratories  including 911 and 420 government-run and private ones  respectively  a record 6 42 588 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours.  The country has carried out over 10.8 million tests since the viral outbreak was first reported.  “The more you test  the better it will in controlling the disease transmission  as you would be picking up cases early who would otherwise be roaming within the community and exposing the vulnerable population to the virus ” says Dr. T Jacob John  former head  virology department  Christian Medical College  Vellore  Tamil Nadu.  The domestic production capacities of various sectors involved in Covid-19 management such as for manufacturing personal protective equipment (PPE) kits  masks  ventilators  and drugs such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have also been ramped up over the past three months.  In terms of healthcare logistics  cumulatively 268.25 lakh N-95 masks  120.40 lakh PPEs  and 1083.77 lakh HCQ tablets have been distributed to all states and Central institutions.  ",delhi,ht
"India’s coronavirus lockdown made little difference to Bollywood superstars but for the industry’s vast army of low-paid  unskilled workers it meant unemployment  hunger and homelessness -- with no end in sight even as shoots gradually resume.

This means that jobs for people like Shaikh are now few and far between. “I am ready to do anything  I desperately need work ” he said. - ‘The littlest players’ - The lockdown cast a spotlight on India’s extreme inequality with well-heeled citizens able to hibernate safely at home while watching shocking scenes of a huge migrant worker exodus play out on their television and smartphone screens. That chasm between the haves and have-nots is perhaps even more pronounced in Bollywood  where jet-setting megastars rub shoulders with tens of thousands of extras  spot boys and other junior crew members who exist on the margins of the glamorous industry. “The spot boys are considered the littlest players  till food arrives late on a set ” actress Richa Chadha wrote on her blog highlighting the “disastrous” effects of the lockdown.

The vast majority of the tens of thousands of industry workers lack access to medical insurance or pension plans.

"Delhi L-G Anil Baijal on Friday overruled the Aam Aadmi party government’s decision to open hotels and allow for weekly bazars on a trial basis under Unlock 3. Unlock 3 is the third phase of the gradual lifting of curbs announced to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease. On Thursday  the Delhi government decided to allow hotels  hospitality services  street hawkers to operate and do away with the night curfew hours applicable between 10pm and 5am under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan. The government intended to allow weekly bazars to operate for a week on a trial basis to check if social distancing norms are adhered to. An official order regarding the same was to come by Saturday.  “These decisions are in continuation of several important decisions taken by CM Arvind Kejriwal in the past few days to ensure Delhi’s economy  which was impacted severely by the lockdown  gets back on track ” said a statement issued by the office of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. Regarding hotels  the statement said  “Since hotels of Delhi are no longer linked to hospitals  Delhi government has also decided to allow normal functioning of hotels and hospitality services  as already permitted under Centre’s unlock guidelines.” The Delhi government had on Wednesday de-linked around 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls that were attached to different hospitals to boost the city’s Covid-19 bed capacity. However  even though the Centre has allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to operate  the government is yet to take a call on it. The Union home ministry issued the plan  Unlock 3  on Wednesday after receiving feedback from states and in consultation with central ministries and departments to open up more activities outside containment zones.

"Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had tried to “scare” people by claiming that Covid-19 cases in Delhi will reach 5.5 lakh by July 31  but the situation was brought under control with the intervention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah  the city BJP unit said on Friday. In June  the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader had said that Delhi was likely to have 5.5 lakh novel coronavirus cases by the end of July and 80 000 beds would be needed to accommodate patients. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta in a press conference asked the Arvind Kejriwal government to answer why it had tried to “scare” people with Sisodia claiming that there would be 5.5 lakh coronavirus cases by July 31. There was no immediate reaction from Sisodia or the AAP on the issue. The national capital has seen a drop in the number of active cases over the past few days.  On Thursday  Delhi had 10 743 active cases  down from 10 770 on Wednesday  10 887 on Tuesday  10 994 on Monday and 11 904 on Sunday. The number of active cases was 27 007 on July 1  according to health department bulletins. “The situation was beyond control of the Delhi government and when Home Minister Amit Shah intervened in mid-June  the cases of Covid-19 started declining  bed availability improved and now the Kejriwal government is taking credit for it ” Gupta claimed. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been saying that the Covid-19 situation has been brought under control for now with the “combined efforts” of the Delhi government  the Centre and the two-crore people of the city  among others. The total count of coronavirus cases as on Thursday was 1 34 403 in Delhi  of which 10 743 were active cases  3 396 deaths and the rest 1 19 724 patients have either recovered  been discharged or migrated.

"The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) on Friday inked a deal with the KVIC to procure a variety of ‘swadeshi’ and ‘khadi’ goods for around 10 lakh personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces. The force will procure 1 200 quintals of mustard oil from the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) with “a total financial implication of over Rs 1.73 crore”  an ITBP spokesperson said. “A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two sides on Friday. The aim is to increasingly procure ‘swadeshi’ or indigenously made products ” he said.   The MoU was signed by KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena and officials of the ITBP procurement wing in Delhi.   The ITBP  a mountain-warfare trained force for guarding the 3 488-km-longs Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China  is the first among the paramilitary or CAPFs to ink such a deal. The other Central Armed Police Forces are the CRPF  CISF  BSF and the SSB. Home Minister Amit Shah had declared few months ago that the CAPF canteens will only sell ‘swadeshi’ or indigenous products from June. Apart from mustard oil  the ITBP is also procuring durries (mats)  towels and blankets from the suppliers empanelled with the KVIC. “Approximately 2.5 lakh durries will be procured by ITBP at a cost of Rs 17 crore. The force is the nodal agency for procurement of durries for all CAPFs ” the spokesperson said. The ITBP has also suggested that yoga kits  hospital bed sheets  ‘khadi’ uniform  pickels and some other items can be purchased for the CAPF jawans through KVIC  a senior official said. These items will also be sold to the personnel and their families through the CAPF canteens. These canteens  with a network of 1 700 stores  do an estimated business worth Rs 2 800 crore annually by selling their products to 50 lakh family members of about 10 lakh personnel of these forces tasked with a variety of internal security work apart from border guarding duties. The KVIC  according to its profile statement  is charged with the planning  promotion  organisation and implementation of programmes for the development of khadi and other village industries in the rural areas in coordination with other agencies engaged in rural development wherever necessary.

"Wow  she speaks such free-flowing Hindi! Now  this might sound like an awkward compliment in the Hindi-speaking Delhi region. But then Hindi is not Veena’s first language. “Main Tamil Nadu ki hoon ” she says  giving away her origins in Hindi.  This afternoon Veena is chatting on WhatsApp video from the isolation of her ground-floor home in Gurugram’s Sector 51  which she shares with her husband and their two daughters. During the coronavirus-triggered lockdown  Veena  39  launched a multi-lingual YouTube channel called Gurugram Sisters  which basically consists of the dance and song performances etc. of two young sisters. “They are my daughters  Shivli and Aditri ” reveals Veena  effortlessly switching into an equally fluent English. Veena grew up in Coimbatore’s Kuniamuthur neighbourhood. While a computer engineer student in a college of the same city  she met Visheshwar Dayal  a student hailing from Delhi’s Kamla Nagar neighbourhood. Their friendship evolved into love and a few years later Veena Jayam stepped into the Hindi speaking world by becoming Veena Mathur. “I was the first one in my entire khandaan to marry a non-Tamilian.” Veena was 24. It is considered relatively easy to learn a new language as a child  but not so as an adult when one’s first language has already taken over much of the linguistic mind space. Veena agrees with this theory and gratefully credits her husband’s parents in helping her with Hindi. “They gently nudged me to chat with them in whatever Hindi phrases I could manage.” At first the Tamilian was quite shy to speak outside—they were living in Indore then—fearing that people might laugh at her attempts. “But almost everyone would praise me for being so good with a language that wasn’t my own.” Truth be told  Veena confides that learning Tamil is slightly more tough than Hindi. “After all  Sanskrit came much after Tamil... and some pronunciations in Tamil take time to master.” Anyhow  the Tamil-Hindi speaker has been living in the Delhi region—Gurugram specifically—since 2010 where she hardly gets an opportunity to speak in her native tongue outside her home. “I personally know only one or two Tamil families here.” Veena says she talks to her husband mostly in Hindi and English—“He understands Tamil but he never talks to me in Tamil out of shyness... though I have heard him speaking it with others.” She engages with her daughters mostly in Hindi  but makes it a point to also converse with them in Tamil  “because it is good to be proficient in many languages.” The lady insists that she can do all the North Indian Hindi-language prayers of her Mathur family “but when I’m praying from my inner heart  the prayers instinctively come out in Tamil.” She laughs confessing it. Even so  nobody is perfect. Veena still has to learn the numbers in Hindi. “I can say do sau (200) and teen sau (300) but I don’t know how to say the beech-wale (middle) numbers.”  And now the lady calls her daughters to the living room  where they often shoot their YouTube videos. “All that’s needed for a good recording is a tripod stand and a camera  and a mike for my elder daughter who loves to sing; the younger one is more into dancing.” Speaking of their next performance  Veena says  “Engaludaya adutha video janmashtamiyai munnitu Lagaan padathulirindu ‘Radha kaise na jale’ paadalil oru arumayana nadanam.” What  you don’t get it? Go  learn Tamil.  ",delhi,ht

Veena agrees with this theory and gratefully credits her husband’s parents in helping her with Hindi. “They gently nudged me to chat with them in whatever Hindi phrases I could manage.” At first the Tamilian was quite shy to speak outside—they were living in Indore then—fearing that people might laugh at her attempts. “But almost everyone would praise me for being so good with a language that wasn’t my own.” Truth be told  Veena confides that learning Tamil is slightly more tough than Hindi. “After all  Sanskrit came much after Tamil... and some pronunciations in Tamil take time to master.” Anyhow  the Tamil-Hindi speaker has been living in the Delhi region—Gurugram specifically—since 2010 where she hardly gets an opportunity to speak in her native tongue outside her home. “I personally know only one or two Tamil families here.” Veena says she talks to her husband mostly in Hindi and English—“He understands Tamil but he never talks to me in Tamil out of shyness... though I have heard him speaking it with others.” She engages with her daughters mostly in Hindi  but makes it a point to also converse with them in Tamil  “because it is good to be proficient in many languages.” The lady insists that she can do all the North Indian Hindi-language prayers of her Mathur family “but when I’m praying from my inner heart  the prayers instinctively come out in Tamil.” She laughs confessing it. Even so  nobody is perfect. Veena still has to learn the numbers in Hindi. “I can say do sau (200) and teen sau (300) but I don’t know how to say the beech-wale (middle) numbers.”  And now the lady calls her daughters to the living room  where they often shoot their YouTube videos. “All that’s needed for a good recording is a tripod stand and a camera  and a mike for my elder daughter who loves to sing; the younger one is more into dancing.” Speaking of their next performance  Veena says  “Engaludaya adutha video janmashtamiyai munnitu Lagaan padathulirindu ‘Radha kaise na jale’ paadalil oru arumayana nadanam.” What  you don’t get it?

"Wow  she speaks such free-flowing Hindi! Now  this might sound like an awkward compliment in the Hindi-speaking Delhi region. But then Hindi is not Veena’s first language. “Main Tamil Nadu ki hoon ” she says  giving away her origins in Hindi.  This afternoon Veena is chatting on WhatsApp video from the isolation of her ground-floor home in Gurugram’s Sector 51  which she shares with her husband and their two daughters. During the coronavirus-triggered lockdown  Veena  39  launched a multi-lingual YouTube channel called Gurugram Sisters  which basically consists of the dance and song performances etc. of two young sisters. “They are my daughters  Shivli and Aditri ” reveals Veena  effortlessly switching into an equally fluent English. Veena grew up in Coimbatore’s Kuniamuthur neighbourhood. While a computer engineer student in a college of the same city  she met Visheshwar Dayal  a student hailing from Delhi’s Kamla Nagar neighbourhood.

"On May 6  a towering Neem tree on central Delhi’s Kasturba Gandhi Marg fell dead. This piece of Delhi’s history  which was planted during the British rule  was estimated to be nearly 90 years old and had a girth of 1.8 metres. In the municipal survey report  the cause of the death was simply  identified as “hollowness”.  According to New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) data accessed by HT  1 475 trees have fallen  or dried up and died  or been cut down for construction activities between 2015 and July 3 this year. Apart from ageing  experts blame concretisation and digging of trenches to lay underground cables for the tree deaths  which they say is causing tremendous  ecological damage.  Environmental activists and experts say  that despite a 2013 National Green Tribunal (NGT) order placing a ban on construction anywhere within a one-metre radius of a tree trunk  such activities continue. Frequent soil digging to lay underground cables — which causes severe damage to roots of trees — and the lowering of the water table    which dries out the tap-root    are also reasons behind tree deaths  according to the experts.  In Lutyens’ Delhi  the avenue trees that have fallen in about five-and-a-half years include pilkhan trees on Dr Zakir Hussain Marg; neem trees on Abdul Kalam Road and Prithviraj Road; and imli (tamarind) trees on Tilak Marg and Akbar Road. Nearly 30% of these trees were “heritage trees” that were over 100 years old. The others were planted between 1920 and 1935 during the construction of Lutyens’ Delhi.  Beginning 1912  British planners and arboriculturists planted a specific variety of tree on each avenue. For example  neem trees were planted on Shahjahan Road and Abdul Kalam Road  among others  and jamun on Ashoka Road and Rajpath.  Author and environmentalist Pradip Krishen said trees in the Lutyens’ zone not only have ecological value but are also historically important.  “Even though NDMC is now planting the second line of trees in these avenues  it is no excuse to not take care of the older trees. It will take these new trees years to attain enough height and girth to provide the benefits that the older ones are providing ” Krishen said.  He added: “The loss of any tree is bad news for us  but these trees carry a lot of history with them. Each variety of trees was selected for each avenue keeping the aesthetics and its surroundings in mind. These are a part of the Capital’s history  and horticulture departments must have the good sense to preserve it.”  Data shows that this year alone  41 trees died in the NDMC area due to various reasons such as damage to roots  hollowness  and storms. In 2019  a total of 229 trees died. Out of them  50 were uprooted and 172 dried up. Two were cut for construction work and five were cut because they were categorised as “dangerous”. This year   NDMC has set a target of planting 5 116 trees. In 2019  the agency planted nearly 10 000 trees. However  the survival rate of saplings in this area is 50-60%.   During an inspection conducted  in 1999 to ascertain the reason behind the high mortality of Imli trees on Tilak Marg and Akbar Road  a multi-disciplinary team comprising members from the Dehradun-based Forest Research Institute found that these old trees were mainly falling because of “developmental activities” such as laying of underground electrical wires  telephone cables and water pipelines  according to the findings.  NDMC’S horticulture department is in charge of the maintenance of the trees.  S Chellaiah  director (horticulture)  NDMC  said the trees are primarily uprooted because of concretisation  laying of underground utilities and soil compaction. He stressed that the civic agency is concerned that the falling of these full-grown trees will not only be an environmental loss but also a loss of heritage.  “Considering that most of the wiring [for electricity cables  CCTV cameras  street lights etc.] is laid underground  you will find a web of cables around tree roots. Even if roots are cut or damaged during the digging of trenches  they slowly start decaying and eventually die. Other reasons for trees getting uprooted are concrete-centric development and ageing. Even older trees could have lived for 10-20 years longer if it weren’t for constant digging and concretisation ” Chellaiah said.  The civic agency says it has been proactive in checking trenching work and concretisation to prevent more trees from falling. Early July  NDMC issued a show-cause notice to Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) after reports of damage to trees on Sardar Patel Marg in Chanakyapuri during work to lay underground cables for installing CCTV cameras along the route.  CR Babu  professor emeritus at the Centre for Environment Management of Degraded Ecosystems at Delhi University  said concretisation is a major reason behind trees choking to death across the Capital  but the loss increases when the victims are old  avenue trees.  “Concrete and overhead and underground wiring choke roots and damage canopies. Even though the government has maintained the avenue trees well  by paying a little more attention  we can protect the city’s heritage for some more years. The trees in other parts of the city are in worse conditions. Even if they aren’t chopped off  they die a slow death ” Babu said.  The area under NDMC (43.7 sq km) accounts for just about 3% of the entire city (1484 sq km). Nearly 50% of the NDMC area is under green cover.  Explaining the ecological benefits of the trees  Babu said: “If you assess based on numbers  why does Lutyens’ Delhi always have lower pollution levels compared to the rest of the city? It is because of this canopy of trees that are planted along both sides of the roads there. Trees are efficient scavengers of dust; the amount of dust trapped by these trees is very high. Also  you cannot depend on new plantation because the survival rate of saplings is very low across municipalities  and it takes years for the few survivors to become fully-grown trees.”  Officials in the three other municipalities in Delhi (north  south and east Delhi municipal corporations)  who did not want to be named  said they do not have a proper log of the number of trees in their area and the reasons behind tree deaths.  Officials said even if there are trees in their areas that are older than 100 years  they are neither categorised in terms of plantation dates nor are they treated with any additional care. “We are yet to have a proper tree census to ascertain the number of trees in our area and the reasons behind the death of each tree. We don’t have the means or the finances to undertake such a detailed analysis ” said a senior horticulture department official of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation.  ",delhi,ht

" Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday reduced the value-added tax (VAT) on diesel from 30% to 16.75%  effectively slashing the fuel price by ₹8.36 per litre in the national capital. Currently  the price of diesel is ₹81.94 per litre in Delhi  much higher when compared to petrol  which is ₹80.43 per litre. The new diesel rate will come into effect only after the Delhi government’s issues a gazette notification  which was yet to come till the time of going to the press. Together  we have to revive the economy after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Currently  diesel is quite expensive in Delhi. It costs around ₹82 per litre. The Delhi cabinet on Thursday has decided to reduce the VAT on diesel from 30% to 16.75%. This will reduce the diesel rate by ₹8.36 per litre. The move is likely to help revive Delhi’s economy ” the CM said during a video press briefing.  On May 4  the Delhi government had increased the VAT on both petrol and diesel to 30% from the earlier 27%  on petrol and 16.75% on diesel. So  in essence  Thursday’s announcement amounts to a roll-back of the hiked VAT. The reduction is aimed at increasing Delhi’s revenue  which had dipped by 90% in April because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions  which were enforced from March 25  to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Senior government officials said for the first quarter of the financial year (April to  June)  Delhi earned around ₹2 520 crore as opposed to ₹7 252 crore revenue during the corresponding period the previous year.  “In July  with further relaxation of lockdown norms and revival of economic activities  the state’s revenue increased to some extent and  hence  the decision to reduce VAT on diesel was taken ” said a senior official in the government’s finance department who did not wish to be identified.  “This is one of several measures to revive Delhi’s economy. Earlier this week  we had launched a portal to connect jobseekers with potential employers and the response we have received to that is overwhelming ” Kejriwal said. The chief minister said over 200 000 job vacancies have been posted on the portal and that 7 577 employers and 322 865 jobseekers have registered until Thursday morning.  KS Atwal  president of the All India Motor Transport Congress  welcomed the move and said it was a “big relief” for the transport industry. “The transport industry is under immense pressure ever since the lockdown was imposed. The additional VAT added to the stress. Hence  the roll-back of the hiked VAT has come as a big relief. With competitive prices  a large number of truckers who were getting their vehicles refuelled in neighbouring states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will again start buying diesel from Delhi. Also  the increase in transportation costs would have eventually caused a sharp increase in the price of essentials such as fruits and vegetables  which will not happen now. Other states should follow the Delhi government’s example.” As on Thursday  diesel price in Uttar Pradesh  (varies from district to district) was between ₹73.40 and ₹75.19 per litre  while the price in Haryana was between ₹73.54 and ₹74.98 per litre. Soon after Kejriwal’s announcement  Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national spokesperson Raghav Chadha criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government for increasing the excise duty on diesel. Chadha said  “The AAP government’s decision will do miracles in reviving Delhi’s economy. On the other hand  the BJP-led central government has adopted an extortionist approach  under which they have increased the excise duty on diesel and petrol at least 22 times over a period of 22 days between June 7 and June 29. They should take a leaf out of CM Kejriwal’s book and roll-back the hike.” Hindustan Times had earlier reported that between April 1 and July 1  the share of central and state taxes in petrol and diesel prices in Delhi increased from 45% to 63% for diesel and 54% to 64% for petrol. Central taxes per litre are almost twice state taxes. The Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta hit back saying it was the BJP which pressured the AAP government into rolling back the increased VAT on diesel. Gupta said  “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should open his eyes and see how diesel rates in neighbouring states ruled by the BJP are already low. The AAP government unnecessarily increased diesel rates in the first place by increasing the VAT. We have pressured them into rolling back the additional tax element. Their claim against the BJP with regard to diesel rates is baseless.” Petrol and diesel prices are determined broadly by crude oil rates  and vary in different parts of the country based on VAT charged by each state.

The new diesel rate will come into effect only after the Delhi government’s issues a gazette notification  which was yet to come till the time of going to the press. Together  we have to revive the economy after the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Currently  diesel is quite expensive in Delhi. It costs around ₹82 per litre. The Delhi cabinet on Thursday has decided to reduce the VAT on diesel from 30% to 16.75%. This will reduce the diesel rate by ₹8.36 per litre. The move is likely to help revive Delhi’s economy ” the CM said during a video press briefing.  On May 4  the Delhi government had increased the VAT on both petrol and diesel to 30% from the earlier 27%  on petrol and 16.75% on diesel. So  in essence  Thursday’s announcement amounts to a roll-back of the hiked VAT. The reduction is aimed at increasing Delhi’s revenue  which had dipped by 90% in April because of the nationwide lockdown restrictions  which were enforced from March 25  to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Senior government officials said for the first quarter of the financial year (April to  June)  Delhi earned around ₹2 520 crore as opposed to ₹7 252 crore revenue during the corresponding period the previous year.  “In July  with further relaxation of lockdown norms and revival of economic activities  the state’s revenue increased to some extent and  hence  the decision to reduce VAT on diesel was taken ” said a senior official in the government’s finance department who did not wish to be identified.  “This is one of several measures to revive Delhi’s economy. Earlier this week  we had launched a portal to connect jobseekers with potential employers and the response we have received to that is overwhelming ” Kejriwal said. The chief minister said over 200 000 job vacancies have been posted on the portal and that 7 577 employers and 322 865 jobseekers have registered until Thursday morning.  KS Atwal  president of the All India Motor Transport Congress  welcomed the move and said it was a “big relief” for the transport industry. “The transport industry is under immense pressure ever since the lockdown was imposed. The additional VAT added to the stress. Hence  the roll-back of the hiked VAT has come as a big relief. With competitive prices  a large number of truckers who were getting their vehicles refuelled in neighbouring states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh will again start buying diesel from Delhi. Also  the increase in transportation costs would have eventually caused a sharp increase in the price of essentials such as fruits and vegetables  which will not happen now. Other states should follow the Delhi government’s example.” As on Thursday  diesel price in Uttar Pradesh  (varies from district to district) was between ₹73.40 and ₹75.19 per litre  while the price in Haryana was between ₹73.54 and ₹74.98 per litre. Soon after Kejriwal’s announcement  Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) national spokesperson Raghav Chadha criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government for increasing the excise duty on diesel. Chadha said  “The AAP government’s decision will do miracles in reviving Delhi’s economy. On the other hand  the BJP-led central government has adopted an extortionist approach  under which they have increased the excise duty on diesel and petrol at least 22 times over a period of 22 days between June 7 and June 29. They should take a leaf out of CM Kejriwal’s book and roll-back the hike.” Hindustan Times had earlier reported that between April 1 and July 1  the share of central and state taxes in petrol and diesel prices in Delhi increased from 45% to 63% for diesel and 54% to 64% for petrol. Central taxes per litre are almost twice state taxes. The Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta hit back saying it was the BJP which pressured the AAP government into rolling back the increased VAT on diesel. Gupta said  “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should open his eyes and see how diesel rates in neighbouring states ruled by the BJP are already low. The AAP government unnecessarily increased diesel rates in the first place by increasing the VAT. We have pressured them into rolling back the additional tax element. Their claim against the BJP with regard to diesel rates is baseless.” Petrol and diesel prices are determined broadly by crude oil rates  and vary in different parts of the country based on VAT charged by each state.

" The Union health ministry intends to replicate the “successful Delhi model” in other states with large outbreaks of Covid-19  a Union health ministry official said on Thursday  citing the example of how authorities in the national capital were able to bring down a key metric – the case positivity rate – from 37% in June to 6% this week. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage Case positivity rate refers to the number of people found positive among all people who are tested for Covid-19 on a particular day – a proportion that determines how prevalent the disease is and how well health officials are able to catch and isolate patients.  “The improved numbers show that test  trace and treat strategy has worked very well and Delhi is a prime example before us as it managed to successfully contain the disease spread with the help of the centre. The situation is being managed in two ways: keeping the infection low  and also keeping the mortality low. Experts have shown that in 80% of the positive cases it is possible to trace close contacts within 72 hours. This model will have to be adopted in other states also ” said Rajesh Bhushan  officer on special duty  health ministry.  In an interview to HT on July 18  chief minister Arvind Kejriwal credited a five-point “Delhi Model” – increased testing  home isolation of mild cases  availability of hospital beds  transparency of data  and plasma therapy – for helping the region become one of the few in the country to be able to rein in the outbreak. On Thursday  the health ministry’s Bhushan reiterated there was no community transmission in the country. “In India  there are clusters of cases and pockets of localised transmission  and the solution to contain it lies in aggressive testing  effective surveillance  contact tracing and clinical management of those infected to be able to fight it successfully ” he said.  Bhushan also referred to the one million recoveries  a milestone India passed on Wednesday and said it “shows how much effort has been put in by our doctors  nurses  paramedic and other frontline workers in managing the outbreak”.  India’s case fatality rate also declined from 3.33% on June 18 to 2.21% on July 30  he said  adding: “Our target is to bring the case fatality rate to 1% or less  and case positivity rate to 10% in first phase  and later to 5% in states with high case load as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines ” said Bhushan.  Eight states have achieved a case fatality rate of 1% and below.  “The ultimate aim is to save lives and it is a positive trend that we are losing fewer patients as compared to other Covid-19 affected countries ” says Dr GC Khilnani  former head  pulmonology department  All India Institute of Medical Sciences  Delhi.

" The Delhi government has decided to allow hotels  hospitality services  street hawkers to operate and do away with the night curfew hours applicable between 10pm and 5am under the Centre’s Unlock 3 plan  the third phase of the gradual lifting of curbs announced to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).   Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The Delhi government will allow weekly bazars to operate for a week on a trial basis to check if social distancing norms are adhered to. An official order to implement the relaxations in Delhi is likely to be issued by Saturday  said a senior government official. However  even though the Centre has allowed gymnasiums and yoga centres to operate  the Delhi government is yet to take a call on it.   Senior government officials said that L-G Anil Baijal in his meeting with Kejriwal on Wednesday had expressed his unwillingness to open gyms and yoga centres as of now. “So  the chief minister has said that a decision on this will be taken in a week’s time after consulting with al stakeholders ” an official said.  A media advisor to the chief minister said marriages/events with the restriction of 50 people can now be held in banquet halls  which come under the hospitality services. The Union home ministry issued the plan  “Unlock 3”  on Wednesday prepared after receiving feedback from states and in consultation held with central ministries and departments  to open up more activities outside containment zones. “These decisions are in continuation of several important decisions taken by CM Arvind Kejriwal in the past few days to ensure Delhi’s economy  which was impacted severely by the lockdown  gets back on track ” said a a statement issued by the office of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday. Regarding hotels  the statement said  “Since hotels of Delhi are no longer linked to hospitals  Delhi government has also decided to allow normal functioning of hotels and hospitality services  as already permitted under Centre’s unlock guidelines.” The Delhi government had on Wednesday de-linked around 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls attached to different hospitals to augment the city’s Covid-19 bed capacity. Sandeep Khandelwal  president of Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association  said: “It is a great relief for thousands of people who are directly or indirectly employed with the hotel industry – from managers  housekeeping staff  chefs and waiters to plumbers  electricians and scores of other people engaged in different roles. Now that the economy is reviving  it may take a month or two  but business will get back to normal very soon.” Gym owners said they expect the government to allow them to operate soon. Chirag Sethi  vice-president Delhi Gym Association  said: “This is a very tough situation for us. We expect the government to allow gyms to open as soon as possible because livelihood of over a lakh people in Delhi depend on fitness industry. More wait will cause more revenue loss for the industry which had been completely shut for over 120 days. Gym owners have already started sanitisation of their gyms and are preparing SOPs (standard operating procedures) to operate gyms and fitness centres. We will meet the CM tomorrow and appeal the government to open gyms without any further delay.” Arbind Singh  national convener of National Association of Street Vendors in India  said: “It is a welcome move because street vendors are struggling since the lockdown was implemented.

"Containment zones in Delhi can now be de-notified in two weeks — down from 28 days  from the day the last Covid-19 patient in the area recovers  the state health department said on Thursday  a move that will bring significant relief to residents of some red zones in the city that have been contained for months.  The decision to relax containment norms  taken by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) on Wednesday  had been a long-standing demand of the Delhi government  with several containment zones in the national capital having been under complete lockdown for more than three months now. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The health ministry had on Wednesday issued an office memorandum to all states and union territories  saying a few states had experienced continuing outbreaks in some containment zones (CZs) and buffer zones (that encircle the CZs)  keeping them under lockdown for months. “In such cases  to have another period of 28 days  to de-notify such CZs brings hardships to its residents. Hence  some states have requested to review the same ” it said. The Delhi government on Thursday welcomed the move and said all district administrations have been asked to now follow the new rules issued by the health ministry. “Delhi was one the first states to urge the Centre to reduce the number of days it takes to de-seal a containment zone. The new guidelines will be strictly followed in Delhi. Aggressive contact tracing and active surveillance of high risk groups and symptomatic persons will continue in such areas ” the chief minister’s office said.  The union health ministry’s document mentioned that states which have CZs with prolonged lockdowns may choose to de-notify a containment zone “14 days after discharge of the last confirmed case (instead of 28 days)”. Also read: Health ministry to replicate Delhi’s Covid-19 model in other states “The surveillance operations will be scaled down if no laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 case is reported from the containment zone for at least 14 days after the last confirmed case has been isolated and all the contacts of the confirmed case have been followed up for 14 days ” the document seen by HT read.  However  the central government also made it clear that surveillance for influenza-like illnesses (ILI)  severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and rigorous testing for these will continue in de-notified containment and buffer zones. “If further positive cases emerge in the de-notified containment or buffer zone  the area will again be declared as a containment zone and the containment process shall begin afresh ” the memorandum read. A city/district/state can be declared “free from the disease outbreak” only after 28 days have passed since the last confirmed case has been tested negative through an RT-PCR diagnosis. The Centre  however  also came down on states and union territories for not being able to break the chain of transmission for prolonged periods in some containment zones.  “It is noted that such continuing outbreaks in CZ/BZs reflect less than satisfactory active surveillance  contact testing  testing and inadequate adherence to home isolation guidelines. Hence  to avoid such a situation  the CZ needs to be redefined  surveillance strengthened and testing increased manifold ” it said. As on Thursday  Delhi had 694 containment zones and at least 300 000 people live in such areas. There were at least five areas in Delhi that had been contained for over three months  including GTB Enclave’s E-block  K and G blocks in Jahangirpuri  Majlis Park in Adarsh Nagar and Hauz Rani. Apart from this  two lanes in southeast Delhi’s Chandni Mahal were under lockdown for at least 88 days. In an interview with HT on July 18  chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Centre’s rules on containment zones needed serious reconsideration  adding that the Delhi government had made multiple requests to the Central government to relax containment norms in the city.  “The Centre’s rule says that if there is no new Covid case for 28 days straight then that area can be de-contained. But if even a single new Covid case emerges in a containment zone then it will remain under lockdown for 28 more days. As a result there are some containment zones which are under lockdown for 3-4 months. People are very distressed in these zones because they are completely locked down in their houses. “We have spoken to the Central government  to the Union health and family welfare ministry and have requested them to fix an outer time limit as well. Just like a country cannot be under a permanent lockdown  localities too cannot operate that way. Permanent lockdown cannot be a long-term solution. The Central government has appreciated our feedback and said that similar complaints have come from other states too. They are now revising the guidelines ” Kejriwal had said. ",delhi,ht

The Centre  however  also came down on states and union territories for not being able to break the chain of transmission for prolonged periods in some containment zones.  “It is noted that such continuing outbreaks in CZ/BZs reflect less than satisfactory active surveillance  contact testing  testing and inadequate adherence to home isolation guidelines. Hence  to avoid such a situation  the CZ needs to be redefined  surveillance strengthened and testing increased manifold ” it said. As on Thursday  Delhi had 694 containment zones and at least 300 000 people live in such areas. There were at least five areas in Delhi that had been contained for over three months  including GTB Enclave’s E-block  K and G blocks in Jahangirpuri  Majlis Park in Adarsh Nagar and Hauz Rani. Apart from this  two lanes in southeast Delhi’s Chandni Mahal were under lockdown for at least 88 days. In an interview with HT on July 18  chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the Centre’s rules on containment zones needed serious reconsideration  adding that the Delhi government had made multiple requests to the Central government to relax containment norms in the city.  “The Centre’s rule says that if there is no new Covid case for 28 days straight then that area can be de-contained. But if even a single new Covid case emerges in a containment zone then it will remain under lockdown for 28 more days. As a result there are some containment zones which are under lockdown for 3-4 months. People are very distressed in these zones because they are completely locked down in their houses. “We have spoken to the Central government  to the Union health and family welfare ministry and have requested them to fix an outer time limit as well. Just like a country cannot be under a permanent lockdown  localities too cannot operate that way. Permanent lockdown cannot be a long-term solution. The Central government has appreciated our feedback and said that similar complaints have come from other states too. They are now revising the guidelines ” Kejriwal had said. ",delhi,ht
"Containment zones in Delhi can now be de-notified in two weeks — down from 28 days  from the day the last Covid-19 patient in the area recovers  the state health department said on Thursday  a move that will bring significant relief to residents of some red zones in the city that have been contained for months.  The decision to relax containment norms  taken by the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoH&FW) on Wednesday  had been a long-standing demand of the Delhi government  with several containment zones in the national capital having been under complete lockdown for more than three months now. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage The health ministry had on Wednesday issued an office memorandum to all states and union territories  saying a few states had experienced continuing outbreaks in some containment zones (CZs) and buffer zones (that encircle the CZs)  keeping them under lockdown for months. “In such cases  to have another period of 28 days  to de-notify such CZs brings hardships to its residents. Hence  some states have requested to review the same ” it said. The Delhi government on Thursday welcomed the move and said all district administrations have been asked to now follow the new rules issued by the health ministry. “Delhi was one the first states to urge the Centre to reduce the number of days it takes to de-seal a containment zone. The new guidelines will be strictly followed in Delhi. Aggressive contact tracing and active surveillance of high risk groups and symptomatic persons will continue in such areas ” the chief minister’s office said.  The union health ministry’s document mentioned that states which have CZs with prolonged lockdowns may choose to de-notify a containment zone “14 days after discharge of the last confirmed case (instead of 28 days)”.

" Even as the number of deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi has dropped  the government has set up four committees of four members each to inspect hospitals and wards that are reporting the highest number of deaths.

The committee consists of doctors from hospitals managing Covid-19 like Lok Nayak and Safdarjung as well as non-Covid hospitals like Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital  Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital  and Aruna Asaf Ali government hospital.  “There has been a reduction in the number of deaths due to corona  however  we need to reduce it further. Today  we constituted four committees that will inspect hospitals and provide suggestion --- 1. Where there have been more deaths  2. Where there have been more deaths in the wards  meaning patients were not moved to the ICU on time ” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet.  On Thursday  Delhi recorded 29 deaths due to Covid-19 across the city  taking the total toll to 3 936. On average  the city recorded about 27 deaths during the previous week.

Once we do  we will decide along with other committee members what aspects we have to observe. Most likely we have to see whether they have adequate facilities and whether the standard of care was followed. However  from what I have seen at our hospital  the mortality has actually gone down significantly now and the patients who do die are the ones who have multiple co-morbid conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes with kidney disease etc. The young or relatively healthy people who do die sometimes are those who reach the hospital late when their oxygen saturation is already very low ” said one of the committee members from Lok Nayak hospital  on condition of anonymity.

"A young man from New Delhi was arrested from a hospital in Bhopal by the crime branch of Bhopal Police on Thursday for allegedly spreading rumours related to Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan  additional superintendent of police (ASP)  Crime Branch  Bhopal said.  Rajan Singh called a press conference in Bhopal around noon on Thursday but he was arrested by the crime branch in the morning.  Earlier  the police had registered an FIR on Tuesday against Rajan Singh  21  under Sections 501 (Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory)  505 (making statements conducing to public mischief) and 188 (punishment for disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  ASP  crime branch  Gopal Dhakad said  “Since CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan declared on Twitter on Saturday that he had tested Covid-19 positive  Rajan Singh has been spreading rumours on social media by showing some fake reports and claiming that the CM is lying.”  “We arrested him from a hospital on Thursday. Singh is presently residing in Bhopal to carry out some research on malnutrition as he claims but his credentials are doubtful. Initially  he claimed to be a medico and later he said he was conferred a doctorate degree by a private university. We are interrogating him to know as to why he is spreading rumours. Is this a part of a publicity stunt or is there someone else who is using him to malign the image of the CM.”  Rajan Singh on Tuesday released a video questioning the Covid-19 reports of CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and also the credibility of a hospital administration where the CM is taking treatment.  In another video released on Wednesday from a private hospital  Rajan Singh said  “I have just requested the CM to show his reports but police registered an FIR against me. What kind of democratic state is this where we are sent behind bars for asking a question?”  ",delhi,ht
"The Delhi Police on Monday sought Umar Khalid’s 10-day custody as they produced him before the Karkardooma district court via video conferencing a day after arresting the activist under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for alleged role in the conspiracy behind the February riots in the national capital. Also Read: Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riots Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat  that Khalid has to be confronted with voluminous documentary evidence. The Delhi Police’s special cell is looking into a larger conspiracy case in addition to multiple cases filed in connection with the riots that left 53 people dead and close to 400 injured. In separate charge sheets related to the riots  the police have said Khalid met suspended and jailed Aam Aadmi Party’s councillor Tahir Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi on January 8 at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)-National Register of Citiznens (NRC) to allegedly plan the riots. He has been interrogated twice in the last two months for his alleged role. The police have also linked Khalid’s speeches to the riots. Khalid’s lawyer  Trideep Pais  told the court the police have to clarify where he gave the speeches and show the proof that his client asked people to come and protest. He added Khalid is against the CAA and he is not ashamed of it.  Khalid’s father  Sayed Qasim Rasool Ilyas  has accused the Delhi police of targeting those who participated in the protests against the CAA and NRC. “This is nothing but an attempt to corner the activists and silence the voices of those who dissent against the government. The Delhi police have been trying to weave a false story by naming few people who participated in the anti-CAA-NRC protests  including Umar  as the ‘masterminds’ behind the north-east [Delhi] violence. However  everyone knows who was actually behind the riots.” The riots were triggered following clashes between supporters of the CAA and its opponents. The CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims  who have entered India from Afghanistan  Pakistan  and Bangladesh before December 31  2014  triggered protests across the country.  Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a proposed pan-India NRC. A process carried out in Assam to detect undocumented immigrants led to the exclusion of around two million people from the NRC in 2018. Khalid was arrested after being questioned twice. He has denied the allegations  calling the inquiry a conspiracy.

The CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims  who have entered India from Afghanistan  Pakistan  and Bangladesh before December 31  2014  triggered protests across the country.  Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).

"The Supreme Court was on Monday informed that the Centre and Delhi government are in the process of making a decision with regard to the clearing of 48 000 slums situated adjacent to railway tracks in Delhi. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the top court that no demolition action will commence till a decision is in place by the Indian Railways  ministry of urban development and Delhi government. The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde recorded this submission of Mehta and adjourned the matter after four weeks. On August 31  the Supreme Court had directed the Indian Railways to remove the 48 000 slums situated in the railway’s safety zone within three months. The court further directed that no court in Delhi would stay the demolition process. Applications were filed by senior Congress leader Ajay Maken and 11 slum dwellers asking the top court not to remove close to 2.4 lakh dwellers till alternate housing is provided to them. Mehta informed the top court that under August 31 order no demolition has started and no coercive action will take place till a decision is taken jointly by the Centre and Delhi government. The bench said  “It is fair” and went on to record the submission of Mehta. ",delhi,ht

" “The last six months have been financially exhausting for all of us. I’m glad the government finally decided to heed to our demands and allowed reopening of gyms in the city ” says Ankur Sehgal  owner of two centres of Strength Gym in Paschim Vihar  Delhi. Most gym owners and fitness enthusiasts in Delhi are happy with the recent orders that permit reopening of gyms and yoga institutes  within the guidelines that mention how strictly these places need to follow social distancing and other standard operating procedures due to Covid-19 situation. Gym owners feel that the resumption of their businesses will help them pay their employees. “I’ve been lending a helping hand to all my employees  and did not lay off anyone. But  this wasn’t the case with all places in Delhi as many lost their jobs during the time when gyms and other fitness centres were asked to remain shut  and not everyone had an alternate source of living. Hopefully now all those people will get some financial support ” adds Sehgal.  Fitness enthusiasts are excited that they’ll be able to resume their regime  which had taken a hit because of the temporary closure of gyms. “Ever since the lockdown  I tried working out at home and used various apps to keep myself fit. But  it was extremely tough for me to maintain a routine. Now that the gyms are opening up again  I’m happy that I’ll have an hour just to myself ” says Rupsi Kumar  a Delhi-based HR professional. Arpan Khosla  a Dwarka-based stand-up comedian  is hopeful that people will be careful while resuming their visits to fitness centres amid the pandemic  and says  “Though we are still battling cases of Covid-19  I feel it’s a good thing that gyms are reopening since they are important for a person’s physical and mental health; both of which have deteriorated during the pandemic. But  I hope all the safety measures are followed!” “We will ensure all safety measures are complied with ” says Nikhil Kakkar  COO  Gold’s Gym India. Sharing that the safety of their staff and members is on top of their mind  he adds  “Trainers have been asked to wear masks and gloves at all times  and sanitisation stations have been erected at all centres. We will follow basic cleaning and disinfecting protocols  and will sanitise the clubs on an hourly basis. There will be less members for each session in order to main social distancing.” Since the orders came in late night on Sunday  not all gym in the Capital could reopen on Monday morning as many were busy making arrangements to ensure they run in compliance with the Covid-19 safety protocol. But some gym owners are still feeling the pinch of delay in the decision to reopen the gyms. “This decision should have been taken three months back  when salons were allowed to open across India. We made several representations to the government in the last four months  which went unheard ” says Istayak Ansari  founder and director  UFC Gym India  adding that the losses that the industry has suffered will take at least a year to recover. “There has been zero revenue for the last six months  and gym members are expecting their memberships to be extended for the Covid-19 period. This will also lead to revenue loss in absence of any help from the government ” says Ansari. In non-containment zones  yoga institutes have also been granted permission to reopen. Poonam Arora  who runs Priyasha Yoga Studio in Rohini  says  “I’ve reduced my batch size  and am screening all members (before they enter the class).

"For the past six decades  Rajiv Gupta’s family has been selling school and college textbooks from their shop in Delhi’s Nai Sarak  one of the country’s biggest textbook markets. The shop  which saw a never-ending stream of students before the onset of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic  hardly receives any customers these days. “These days  only a few parents come to buy books for their children. My sales have plummeted by 70% this year ” says Gupta.  The continued closure of schools and other educational institutions due to the Coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to the textbook industry  with booksellers and publishers experiencing an unprecedented decline in their business after decades of robust growth.  According to the India Book Market Report by Nielsen released in 2015  there were about 21 000 book retailers and about 9 000 publishers in India  out of which 8 107 published books for schools  colleges and higher educational institutions. Educational books formed about 70% of the book market in India — with the school and college books market valued at ₹18 600 crore and ₹5 600 crore respectively in 2013–14. According to the report  the K-12 books market was likely to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 19.6%  from ₹22 170 crore in 2014-15 to ₹54 190 crore by 2019-20.  But this otherwise exciting story of textbook publishing in India has taken a grim turn with sales of many well-known publishers dropping as much as 50% compared to last year. “Publishers are sitting on massive unsold stocks. Since the Coronavirus lockdown happened in March  the last-mile sales of books suffered. Most publishers had dispatched the books to distributors or bookshops but a lot of stocks are still lying unsold with them. Nearly 30-40% stocks may come back as returns ” said Monica Malhotra Kandhari  vice president  Federation of Indian Publishers and managing director  MBD Group  one of India’s oldest and largest publishing companies. “Our sales have plummeted 50% this academic session ” says Ashwani Goyal  managing director  Goyal Publishers  one of the country’s largest publishers of language learning books.  Many in the industry say that one of the major reasons for the fall in the textbook sales is also the fact that a large number of children of migrant workers in budget schools have gone back to their villages  and are unable to continue their education online. The point is endorsed by the owners of the budget schools.  “Our schools had 400 children  most of them belonging to low-income migrant families  and we have lost touch with 50% of them. We have been able to provide online education to only about 30 children. Our fee is only Rs 700 for Class 8 and Rs 400 for nursery  still only 21 out of 400 children paid fees last month. Their families are struggling for survival; education and books do not seem to be their priority  ” says DP Sharma  who runs Ved Pal Memorial School in Hastal in Uttam Nagar  west Delhi  which has 150 budget schools  most of which came up in the past two decades; most complain of thousands of “missing” students.  Bharat Arora  general secretary  Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools  an association of private schools in Delhi  says that this year many private schools also recommended digital books. “A lot of private schools put the list of books on websites recommended and digital books in case the children were unable to buy physical copies. Besides  schools were also sending chapters of various books online in April . There has never been such online consumption of education content before  ” Arora says.  Ashwani Goyal said what has also affected sales is online piracy “ I am surprised by the number of illegal PDFs of our printed books available online ” says Goyal  who has about 800 titles in circulation  catering to school and college students. In the past few months  he has digitized most of his titles and made them available on e-reading platforms such as Bru.  Like many other publishers  Goyal feels that recycling of old books during the lockdown in April and May also affected sales. Aparajitha Gautam  president  Delhi Parents Association  says that between March and May  the association aggressively promoted the exchange of old books across the city through thousands of parents’ WhatsApp groups. “This helped children procure books when all bookshops were closed and even-e-commerce companies were not delivering books. Eventually  a large number of parents did not buy new books at all  and many bought only a few select books apart from notebooks ” she says.  Ish Kapur  who runs Dhanpat Rai Publications  says sales of books have been affected differently in different parts of the country. “ Textbooks sales are particularly dismal in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu   which are severely hit by the Coronavirus pandemic. The sales of books for primary classes have been particularly bad ” says Kapur  whose publication house is known for its mathematics books by RD Sharma. “Our sales are down by 25%; we have never seen such a downturn in business in our 70-year-old history. The sales of even our best -selling titles have been affected ” adds Kapur.  The textbook industry follows a sales and marketing strategy that is completely different from that of trade publishers because it is aligned with the school academic year.  Every year  in October  representatives and salespersons of various publishing companies start visiting schools across the country for meeting principals and teachers  to make presentations on their books.  “We touched base with 70 000 schools last year. However  we are not sure if we will be able to undertake the same exercise this year as the schools are still closed. The production of books starts in August-September each year; but this year as the publishers are sitting with stocks  it seems only 10-20% production may happen ” says Kandhari.  Talking of the future of print textbooks in the post-Covid world  she says textbook publishers will have to reinvent themselves. “Hybrid model of education with a mix of online and in-person classes is going to be the new normal. The textbooks will co-exist with digital learning content ” says Kandhari. ",delhi,ht

"The country’s most competitive medical entrance examination  the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)  was held in more than 3 800 centres across the country  with strict protocols necessitated by the pandemic  which had also led to the exam being postponed twice previously this year. The exam was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admissions to various medical courses and 15 97 433 candidates had registered to appear in it this year. While the exam began at 2pm  students were asked to report at their respective examination centres in staggered slots from 11am onwards to avoid crowds at a single time in any centre. Outside centres  students were required to stand inside circles drawn on the ground and spaced five or six feet apart.  Candidates’ temperatures were checked before they were allowed into the centres  and upon entering  students were handed fresh face masks and asked to sanitise their hands. Examination halls were allowed to accommodate a maximum of 12 candidates at a time to allow social distance.  Students were not permitted to carry anything other than the admit card  ID cards  two passport-size photographs  a sanitiser and a transparent water bottle. The exam concluded at 5 pm. Over 110 centres in the Capital were earmarked for the exam  and around 54 000 students were supposed to appear in it  with many travelling to the city from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  Among the aspirants was Ankit Mehra  17  who had taken a roadways bus from Haryana’s Rohtak district to his centre in Mayur Vihar. “I took an auto from the bus stand to my exam centre. I was initially scared because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi  but I am satisfied with the arrangements made at the centre ” he said. While many students travelled to the centres in private vehicles  some took taxis  while others used the Delhi Metro  which began operations early on Sunday  in view of the exam.  Shrishti Bansal  18  a resident of Dilshad Garden  who used the Metro to travel to her centre in Rohini. “It was more convenient to take the Metro than a taxi.

Rubina Siddiqui  18  a resident of Shankar Vihar  said  “It’s very challenging to write an exam while wearing a mask and gloves.

We made her sit and take the exam in a separate room ” an official at the centre said. Meanwhile  many parents complained that social distancing was not maintained outside several examination centres. Ramesh Singh  a businessman from Narela whose daughter appeared in the exam at a centre in east Delhi  said  “There was so much crowd outside the exam centre at around 5pm. Many parents were not even wearing masks. People continued to gather there despite officials trying to disperse crowds and requesting parents to keep a distance.” Similar concerns were raised by parents from an examination centre in Narela.  Amit Sehgal  father of an 18-year-old aspirant  said  “My son was satisfied with the management inside the exam centre  but the crowd management outside was very poor.

"The country’s most competitive medical entrance examination  the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)  was held in more than 3 800 centres across the country  with strict protocols necessitated by the pandemic  which had also led to the exam being postponed twice previously this year. The exam was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admissions to various medical courses and 15 97 433 candidates had registered to appear in it this year. While the exam began at 2pm  students were asked to report at their respective examination centres in staggered slots from 11am onwards to avoid crowds at a single time in any centre. Outside centres  students were required to stand inside circles drawn on the ground and spaced five or six feet apart.  Candidates’ temperatures were checked before they were allowed into the centres  and upon entering  students were handed fresh face masks and asked to sanitise their hands. Examination halls were allowed to accommodate a maximum of 12 candidates at a time to allow social distance.  Students were not permitted to carry anything other than the admit card  ID cards  two passport-size photographs  a sanitiser and a transparent water bottle. The exam concluded at 5 pm. Over 110 centres in the Capital were earmarked for the exam  and around 54 000 students were supposed to appear in it  with many travelling to the city from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

"Andhra Pradesh (AP)   Bihar  Gujarat  Haryana  Karnataka  Madhya Pradesh (MP)  Meghalaya  Sikkim  Tripura  Uttar Pradesh (UP)  Uttarakhand and Odisha have opted for the first borrowing option of Rs 97 000 crore to meet the Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall  while Manipur has preferred the second option of a loan of Rs 2.35 lakh crore  two Union finance ministry officials said. So far  13 states have communicated their borrowing options and six states have indicated that they would convey their choice next week  they said requesting anonymity.  The six states are Goa  Assam  Arunachal Pradesh  Nagaland  Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh (HP). Also Read: Gold cheaper by Rs 4 800  being sold at a discount despite fall in price At the 41st GST Council on August 27  the Union government gave two borrowing options to states to meet their revenue shortfall of about Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year.  Two days later  it specified that under the first option  states would not have to pay either principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97 000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation bottlenecks.  However  they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfalls due to an “act of God”  which is the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Some states  where opposition parties are in power  such as Delhi  Kerala  Punjab  West Bengal (WB)  Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh  had initially opposed the Centre’s proposal.  Also Read: Andhra govt hikes VAT on natural gas by 10% to offset revenue losses Addressing a press conference on August 30  WB finance minister Amit Mitra had said a huge debt was being thrust on states in the name of “act of God” — a reference to the phrase used by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to describe the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism that HT had reported on August 31.  Kerala finance minister (FM) Thomas Isaac had tweeted on August 31  “FMs of Punjab  Delhi  WB  Chhattisgarh Telengana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation .Our option: the central government to borrow the entire compensation due regardless of the acts of God  humans or nature   to be paid back by extending the period of cess.” “Initially  many states  where opposition parties in power  had some reservation related to borrowing. Now  they are weighing their options after the Centre has clarified its commitment to pay the entire compensation. They will also communicate their choices soon ” one of the officials quoted above said. On September 3  Union expenditure and revenue secretaries had met virtually with state finance secretaries to explain how the options would work. HT on September 9 had reported that following the Centre’s clarification the only option available to states to receive the GST compensation was to borrow. Most states  including some ruled by parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  were likely to opt for the first of the two options offered on August 27.  Isaac had tweeted on September 9  “I welcome the new stance of the Centre that it was never its idea to deny full GST compensation. Glad to be corrected. But deferring half the compensation for better times  ipso facto  is deferring public expenditures to better times. It is the surest way of deferring future good days.” At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017  the GST law had assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liqour  cigarettes  aerated water  automobiles  coal and other tobacco products.  States and union territories (UTs) require Rs 3 lakh crore GST compensation in the current financial year  an 82% jump from 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue  as the economy has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions  the officials said. According to an official statement released on July 27  the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1 65 302 crore  while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95 444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20  which is the lowest in 11 years.  The 41st council meeting had taken place in the backdrop of the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) for India on the compensation cess issue  where he had said there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue  the officials said.  According to the AG  the GST Council was expected to find ways to meet the shortfall in compensation and not the Central government. “The GST Council offered two options to the states to borrow ” a second official said. “It was discussed in the recent GST Council meeting that in the current economic scenario it may not be possible to increase tax rates or do rate rationalisation to meet the compensation shortfall. However  borrowing could be an option to address this challenge ” he said.

Two days later  it specified that under the first option  states would not have to pay either principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97 000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation bottlenecks.  However  they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfalls due to an “act of God”  which is the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.

Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism that HT had reported on August 31.  Kerala finance minister (FM) Thomas Isaac had tweeted on August 31  “FMs of Punjab  Delhi  WB  Chhattisgarh Telengana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation .Our option: the central government to borrow the entire compensation due regardless of the acts of God  humans or nature   to be paid back by extending the period of cess.” “Initially  many states  where opposition parties in power  had some reservation related to borrowing. Now  they are weighing their options after the Centre has clarified its commitment to pay the entire compensation. They will also communicate their choices soon ” one of the officials quoted above said. On September 3  Union expenditure and revenue secretaries had met virtually with state finance secretaries to explain how the options would work. HT on September 9 had reported that following the Centre’s clarification the only option available to states to receive the GST compensation was to borrow. Most states  including some ruled by parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  were likely to opt for the first of the two options offered on August 27.  Isaac had tweeted on September 9  “I welcome the new stance of the Centre that it was never its idea to deny full GST compensation. Glad to be corrected. But deferring half the compensation for better times  ipso facto  is deferring public expenditures to better times. It is the surest way of deferring future good days.” At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017  the GST law had assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liqour  cigarettes  aerated water  automobiles  coal and other tobacco products.  States and union territories (UTs) require Rs 3 lakh crore GST compensation in the current financial year  an 82% jump from 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue  as the economy has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions  the officials said. According to an official statement released on July 27  the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1 65 302 crore  while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95 444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20  which is the lowest in 11 years.  The 41st council meeting had taken place in the backdrop of the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) for India on the compensation cess issue  where he had said there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue  the officials said.  According to the AG  the GST Council was expected to find ways to meet the shortfall in compensation and not the Central government. “The GST Council offered two options to the states to borrow ” a second official said. “It was discussed in the recent GST Council meeting that in the current economic scenario it may not be possible to increase tax rates or do rate rationalisation to meet the compensation shortfall.

Also Read: Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riots Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat  that Khalid has to be confronted with voluminous documentary evidence. The Delhi Police’s special cell is looking into a larger conspiracy case in addition to multiple cases filed in connection with the riots that left 53 people dead and close to 400 injured. In separate charge sheets related to the riots  the police have said Khalid met suspended and jailed Aam Aadmi Party’s councillor Tahir Hussain and activist Khalid Saifi on January 8 at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest site against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)-National Register of Citiznens (NRC) to allegedly plan the riots. He has been interrogated twice in the last two months for his alleged role. The police have also linked Khalid’s speeches to the riots. Khalid’s lawyer  Trideep Pais  told the court the police have to clarify where he gave the speeches and show the proof that his client asked people to come and protest. He added Khalid is against the CAA and he is not ashamed of it.  Khalid’s father  Sayed Qasim Rasool Ilyas  has accused the Delhi police of targeting those who participated in the protests against the CAA and NRC. “This is nothing but an attempt to corner the activists and silence the voices of those who dissent against the government. The Delhi police have been trying to weave a false story by naming few people who participated in the anti-CAA-NRC protests  including Umar  as the ‘masterminds’ behind the north-east [Delhi] violence. However  everyone knows who was actually behind the riots.” The riots were triggered following clashes between supporters of the CAA and its opponents. The CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims  who have entered India from Afghanistan  Pakistan  and Bangladesh before December 31  2014  triggered protests across the country.  Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a proposed pan-India NRC. A process carried out in Assam to detect undocumented immigrants led to the exclusion of around two million people from the NRC in 2018. Khalid was arrested after being questioned twice.

Cry out  my country https://t.co/cvS7ysd5Ls A group of academics and activists separately issued a statement in Khalid’s support and called his arrest a “witch-hunt”. “As citizens deeply committed to Constitutional values  we condemn the arrest of Umar Khalid who has been subjected to a malicious investigation targeting peaceful anti-CAA protestors. He has been booked under several charges including UAPA  sedition and conspiracy for murder. With deep anguish  we have no doubt in saying that this investigation is not about the violence in February 2020 in the national capital  but on the completely peaceful and democratic protests across the country against the unconstitutional CAA ” the statement said. The signatories to the statement include Ravi Kiran Jain and V Suresh of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties; lawyers Mihir Desai and ND Pancholi; academics Satish Deshpande  Mary John  Apoorvanand  Nandini Sundar and Shuddhabrata Sengupta; and rights activists Aakar Patel  Mander  Farah Naqvi and Biraj Patnaik.

He is undoubtedly among the leaders that India deserves. @DelhiPolice can’t detain India’s future for long ” he tweeted. Shocked that an anti-terror law UAPA has been used to arrest a young  thinking  idealist like @UmarKhalidJNU who has always opposed violence and communalism in any form.He is undoubtedly among the leaders that India deserves.@DelhiPolice can't detain India's future for long. Lawyer Prashant Bhushan called Khalid’s arrest a conspiracy to frame peaceful activists in the guise of investigation. “Umar Khalid’s arrest by Delhi police after naming Yechury  Yogendra Yadav  [academics] Jayati Ghosh & Apoorvanand  leaves no doubt at all about the malafide nature of its investigation into Delhi riots ” he tweeted. Bhushan was referring to a charge sheet related to the riots filed last month that has the statement of an accused attached to it claiming Yechury  Apoorvanand  former lawmaker Chaudhary Mateen and advocate Mahmood Pracha instigated anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protestors. The Delhi police have issued a clarification saying these individuals have not been named as accused in the case. Also Read: Umar Khalid arrested in connection with North-East Delhi riots The riots were triggered following clashes between supporters of the CAA and its opponents. The CAA’s passage in December to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims  who have entered India from Afghanistan  Pakistan  and Bangladesh before December 31  2014  triggered protests across the country.  Opponents of the law insist it is discriminatory and unconstitutional as it leaves out the Muslims and links faith to citizenship in a secular country. They say it could result in the expulsion or detentions of the Muslims unable to provide the documentation if the law is seen in the context of a proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC). A process carried out in Assam to detect undocumented immigrants led to the exclusion of around two million people from NRC in 2018. Activist Harsh Mandar said Khalid speaks about Gandhi and non-violence. “...He’s a youth a country should be proud of - idealistic  progressive  brave. We spoke together in anti-CAA protests: he spoke always of non-violence & Gandhi. Today he’s arrested under draconian UAPA on trumped up charges of conspiracy. Cry out  my country ” he tweeted. #StandWithUmarKhalid He's a youth a country should be proud of - idealistic  progressive  brave. We spoke together in anti-CAA protests: he spoke always of non-violence & Gandhi. Today he's arrested under draconian UAPA on trumped up charges of conspiracy. Cry out  my country https://t.co/cvS7ysd5Ls A group of academics and activists separately issued a statement in Khalid’s support and called his arrest a “witch-hunt”. “As citizens deeply committed to Constitutional values  we condemn the arrest of Umar Khalid who has been subjected to a malicious investigation targeting peaceful anti-CAA protestors. He has been booked under several charges including UAPA  sedition and conspiracy for murder. With deep anguish  we have no doubt in saying that this investigation is not about the violence in February 2020 in the national capital  but on the completely peaceful and democratic protests across the country against the unconstitutional CAA ” the statement said. The signatories to the statement include Ravi Kiran Jain and V Suresh of the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties; lawyers Mihir Desai and ND Pancholi; academics Satish Deshpande  Mary John  Apoorvanand  Nandini Sundar and Shuddhabrata Sengupta; and rights activists Aakar Patel  Mander  Farah Naqvi and Biraj Patnaik.

"The Supreme Court was on Monday informed that the Centre and Delhi government are in the process of making a decision with regard to the clearing of 48 000 slums situated adjacent to railway tracks in Delhi. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed the top court that no demolition action will commence till a decision is in place by the Indian Railways  ministry of urban development and Delhi government. The three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde recorded this submission of Mehta and adjourned the matter after four weeks. On August 31  the Supreme Court had directed the Indian Railways to remove the 48 000 slums situated in the railway’s safety zone within three months. The court further directed that no court in Delhi would stay the demolition process. Applications were filed by senior Congress leader Ajay Maken and 11 slum dwellers asking the top court not to remove close to 2.4 lakh dwellers till alternate housing is provided to them. Mehta informed the top court that under August 31 order no demolition has started and no coercive action will take place till a decision is taken jointly by the Centre and Delhi government. The bench said  “It is fair” and went on to record the submission of Mehta. ",delhi,ht

" “The last six months have been financially exhausting for all of us. I’m glad the government finally decided to heed to our demands and allowed reopening of gyms in the city ” says Ankur Sehgal  owner of two centres of Strength Gym in Paschim Vihar  Delhi. Most gym owners and fitness enthusiasts in Delhi are happy with the recent orders that permit reopening of gyms and yoga institutes  within the guidelines that mention how strictly these places need to follow social distancing and other standard operating procedures due to Covid-19 situation. Gym owners feel that the resumption of their businesses will help them pay their employees. “I’ve been lending a helping hand to all my employees  and did not lay off anyone. But  this wasn’t the case with all places in Delhi as many lost their jobs during the time when gyms and other fitness centres were asked to remain shut  and not everyone had an alternate source of living. Hopefully now all those people will get some financial support ” adds Sehgal.  Fitness enthusiasts are excited that they’ll be able to resume their regime  which had taken a hit because of the temporary closure of gyms. “Ever since the lockdown  I tried working out at home and used various apps to keep myself fit. But  it was extremely tough for me to maintain a routine. Now that the gyms are opening up again  I’m happy that I’ll have an hour just to myself ” says Rupsi Kumar  a Delhi-based HR professional. Arpan Khosla  a Dwarka-based stand-up comedian  is hopeful that people will be careful while resuming their visits to fitness centres amid the pandemic  and says  “Though we are still battling cases of Covid-19  I feel it’s a good thing that gyms are reopening since they are important for a person’s physical and mental health; both of which have deteriorated during the pandemic. But  I hope all the safety measures are followed!” “We will ensure all safety measures are complied with ” says Nikhil Kakkar  COO  Gold’s Gym India. Sharing that the safety of their staff and members is on top of their mind  he adds  “Trainers have been asked to wear masks and gloves at all times  and sanitisation stations have been erected at all centres. We will follow basic cleaning and disinfecting protocols  and will sanitise the clubs on an hourly basis. There will be less members for each session in order to main social distancing.” Since the orders came in late night on Sunday  not all gym in the Capital could reopen on Monday morning as many were busy making arrangements to ensure they run in compliance with the Covid-19 safety protocol. But some gym owners are still feeling the pinch of delay in the decision to reopen the gyms. “This decision should have been taken three months back  when salons were allowed to open across India. We made several representations to the government in the last four months  which went unheard ” says Istayak Ansari  founder and director  UFC Gym India  adding that the losses that the industry has suffered will take at least a year to recover. “There has been zero revenue for the last six months  and gym members are expecting their memberships to be extended for the Covid-19 period. This will also lead to revenue loss in absence of any help from the government ” says Ansari. In non-containment zones  yoga institutes have also been granted permission to reopen. Poonam Arora  who runs Priyasha Yoga Studio in Rohini  says  “I’ve reduced my batch size  and am screening all members (before they enter the class).

"A socio-economic survey conducted by the Delhi government has found that nearly one-third or 33% of the city’s households live in rented accommodations  while the remaining two-third or 66% have their own homes. The survey was carried out by the Delhi Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES). Here’s all you need to know about it: • The survey was carried out between November 2018 and 2019. A total of 20.05 lakh households and 1.02 crore people  were surveyed.

New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC)  meanwhile  was found to have maximum number of households on rent. • Of Delhi’s 11 districts  Shahdara (76.37%) and Central district (72.36%) have the maximum number of households. Debolina Kundu  member of Delhi’s fifth finance commission  says this shows Delhi still has large number of unauthorised colonies and slums. •  51.78% of the 20.05 lakh households surveyed were found to have vehicles for personal use.

"For the past six decades  Rajiv Gupta’s family has been selling school and college textbooks from their shop in Delhi’s Nai Sarak  one of the country’s biggest textbook markets. The shop  which saw a never-ending stream of students before the onset of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic  hardly receives any customers these days. “These days  only a few parents come to buy books for their children. My sales have plummeted by 70% this year ” says Gupta.  The continued closure of schools and other educational institutions due to the Coronavirus pandemic has dealt a blow to the textbook industry  with booksellers and publishers experiencing an unprecedented decline in their business after decades of robust growth.  According to the India Book Market Report by Nielsen released in 2015  there were about 21 000 book retailers and about 9 000 publishers in India  out of which 8 107 published books for schools  colleges and higher educational institutions. Educational books formed about 70% of the book market in India — with the school and college books market valued at ₹18 600 crore and ₹5 600 crore respectively in 2013–14. According to the report  the K-12 books market was likely to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 19.6%  from ₹22 170 crore in 2014-15 to ₹54 190 crore by 2019-20.  But this otherwise exciting story of textbook publishing in India has taken a grim turn with sales of many well-known publishers dropping as much as 50% compared to last year. “Publishers are sitting on massive unsold stocks. Since the Coronavirus lockdown happened in March  the last-mile sales of books suffered. Most publishers had dispatched the books to distributors or bookshops but a lot of stocks are still lying unsold with them. Nearly 30-40% stocks may come back as returns ” said Monica Malhotra Kandhari  vice president  Federation of Indian Publishers and managing director  MBD Group  one of India’s oldest and largest publishing companies. “Our sales have plummeted 50% this academic session ” says Ashwani Goyal  managing director  Goyal Publishers  one of the country’s largest publishers of language learning books.  Many in the industry say that one of the major reasons for the fall in the textbook sales is also the fact that a large number of children of migrant workers in budget schools have gone back to their villages  and are unable to continue their education online. The point is endorsed by the owners of the budget schools.  “Our schools had 400 children  most of them belonging to low-income migrant families  and we have lost touch with 50% of them. We have been able to provide online education to only about 30 children. Our fee is only Rs 700 for Class 8 and Rs 400 for nursery  still only 21 out of 400 children paid fees last month. Their families are struggling for survival; education and books do not seem to be their priority  ” says DP Sharma  who runs Ved Pal Memorial School in Hastal in Uttam Nagar  west Delhi  which has 150 budget schools  most of which came up in the past two decades; most complain of thousands of “missing” students.  Bharat Arora  general secretary  Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools  an association of private schools in Delhi  says that this year many private schools also recommended digital books. “A lot of private schools put the list of books on websites recommended and digital books in case the children were unable to buy physical copies. Besides  schools were also sending chapters of various books online in April . There has never been such online consumption of education content before  ” Arora says.  Ashwani Goyal said what has also affected sales is online piracy “ I am surprised by the number of illegal PDFs of our printed books available online ” says Goyal  who has about 800 titles in circulation  catering to school and college students. In the past few months  he has digitized most of his titles and made them available on e-reading platforms such as Bru.  Like many other publishers  Goyal feels that recycling of old books during the lockdown in April and May also affected sales. Aparajitha Gautam  president  Delhi Parents Association  says that between March and May  the association aggressively promoted the exchange of old books across the city through thousands of parents’ WhatsApp groups. “This helped children procure books when all bookshops were closed and even-e-commerce companies were not delivering books. Eventually  a large number of parents did not buy new books at all  and many bought only a few select books apart from notebooks ” she says.  Ish Kapur  who runs Dhanpat Rai Publications  says sales of books have been affected differently in different parts of the country. “ Textbooks sales are particularly dismal in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu   which are severely hit by the Coronavirus pandemic. The sales of books for primary classes have been particularly bad ” says Kapur  whose publication house is known for its mathematics books by RD Sharma. “Our sales are down by 25%; we have never seen such a downturn in business in our 70-year-old history. The sales of even our best -selling titles have been affected ” adds Kapur.  The textbook industry follows a sales and marketing strategy that is completely different from that of trade publishers because it is aligned with the school academic year.  Every year  in October  representatives and salespersons of various publishing companies start visiting schools across the country for meeting principals and teachers  to make presentations on their books.  “We touched base with 70 000 schools last year. However  we are not sure if we will be able to undertake the same exercise this year as the schools are still closed. The production of books starts in August-September each year; but this year as the publishers are sitting with stocks  it seems only 10-20% production may happen ” says Kandhari.  Talking of the future of print textbooks in the post-Covid world  she says textbook publishers will have to reinvent themselves. “Hybrid model of education with a mix of online and in-person classes is going to be the new normal.

"The country’s most competitive medical entrance examination  the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)  was held in more than 3 800 centres across the country  with strict protocols necessitated by the pandemic  which had also led to the exam being postponed twice previously this year. The exam was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admissions to various medical courses and 15 97 433 candidates had registered to appear in it this year. While the exam began at 2pm  students were asked to report at their respective examination centres in staggered slots from 11am onwards to avoid crowds at a single time in any centre. Outside centres  students were required to stand inside circles drawn on the ground and spaced five or six feet apart.  Candidates’ temperatures were checked before they were allowed into the centres  and upon entering  students were handed fresh face masks and asked to sanitise their hands. Examination halls were allowed to accommodate a maximum of 12 candidates at a time to allow social distance.  Students were not permitted to carry anything other than the admit card  ID cards  two passport-size photographs  a sanitiser and a transparent water bottle. The exam concluded at 5 pm. Over 110 centres in the Capital were earmarked for the exam  and around 54 000 students were supposed to appear in it  with many travelling to the city from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.  Among the aspirants was Ankit Mehra  17  who had taken a roadways bus from Haryana’s Rohtak district to his centre in Mayur Vihar. “I took an auto from the bus stand to my exam centre. I was initially scared because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi  but I am satisfied with the arrangements made at the centre ” he said. While many students travelled to the centres in private vehicles  some took taxis  while others used the Delhi Metro  which began operations early on Sunday  in view of the exam.  Shrishti Bansal  18  a resident of Dilshad Garden  who used the Metro to travel to her centre in Rohini. “It was more convenient to take the Metro than a taxi. I was glad the service restarted operations before the exam  because we don’t own a vehicle ” she said. Many students  however  said they had a tough time writing exams while wearing gloves.  Rubina Siddiqui  18  a resident of Shankar Vihar  said  “It’s very challenging to write an exam while wearing a mask and gloves. It would have been better if the exam was being conducted on computers at the centres.” Most students  however  said they were relieved the exam is now over.  Sweta Singh  19  a resident of Lakshmi Nagar  said she had dropped a year to prepare for NEET. “I was getting very anxious because of the delay in the exam... I was waiting for this exam for the last 18 months  and am glad it’s finished now ” she said. The NTA allowed in students with high body temperature  but no other Covid-19 symptoms.  At an examination centre in north Delhi’s Raj Niwas Road  special arrangements were made for a student after her temperature was recorded to be above the normal. “The student had no other symptoms. We made her sit and take the exam in a separate room ” an official at the centre said. Meanwhile  many parents complained that social distancing was not maintained outside several examination centres. Ramesh Singh  a businessman from Narela whose daughter appeared in the exam at a centre in east Delhi  said  “There was so much crowd outside the exam centre at around 5pm. Many parents were not even wearing masks. People continued to gather there despite officials trying to disperse crowds and requesting parents to keep a distance.” Similar concerns were raised by parents from an examination centre in Narela.  Amit Sehgal  father of an 18-year-old aspirant  said  “My son was satisfied with the management inside the exam centre  but the crowd management outside was very poor. There was a sea of parents outside the centre in the evening  with no proper distancing maintained.” ",delhi,ht

I was initially scared because of the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi  but I am satisfied with the arrangements made at the centre ” he said. While many students travelled to the centres in private vehicles  some took taxis  while others used the Delhi Metro  which began operations early on Sunday  in view of the exam.  Shrishti Bansal  18  a resident of Dilshad Garden  who used the Metro to travel to her centre in Rohini. “It was more convenient to take the Metro than a taxi. I was glad the service restarted operations before the exam  because we don’t own a vehicle ” she said. Many students  however  said they had a tough time writing exams while wearing gloves.  Rubina Siddiqui  18  a resident of Shankar Vihar  said  “It’s very challenging to write an exam while wearing a mask and gloves. It would have been better if the exam was being conducted on computers at the centres.” Most students  however  said they were relieved the exam is now over.  Sweta Singh  19  a resident of Lakshmi Nagar  said she had dropped a year to prepare for NEET. “I was getting very anxious because of the delay in the exam... I was waiting for this exam for the last 18 months  and am glad it’s finished now ” she said. The NTA allowed in students with high body temperature  but no other Covid-19 symptoms.  At an examination centre in north Delhi’s Raj Niwas Road  special arrangements were made for a student after her temperature was recorded to be above the normal. “The student had no other symptoms. We made her sit and take the exam in a separate room ” an official at the centre said. Meanwhile  many parents complained that social distancing was not maintained outside several examination centres. Ramesh Singh  a businessman from Narela whose daughter appeared in the exam at a centre in east Delhi  said  “There was so much crowd outside the exam centre at around 5pm. Many parents were not even wearing masks. People continued to gather there despite officials trying to disperse crowds and requesting parents to keep a distance.” Similar concerns were raised by parents from an examination centre in Narela.  Amit Sehgal  father of an 18-year-old aspirant  said  “My son was satisfied with the management inside the exam centre  but the crowd management outside was very poor. There was a sea of parents outside the centre in the evening  with no proper distancing maintained.” ",delhi,ht
"The country’s most competitive medical entrance examination  the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET)  was held in more than 3 800 centres across the country  with strict protocols necessitated by the pandemic  which had also led to the exam being postponed twice previously this year. The exam was conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for admissions to various medical courses and 15 97 433 candidates had registered to appear in it this year. While the exam began at 2pm  students were asked to report at their respective examination centres in staggered slots from 11am onwards to avoid crowds at a single time in any centre. Outside centres  students were required to stand inside circles drawn on the ground and spaced five or six feet apart.  Candidates’ temperatures were checked before they were allowed into the centres  and upon entering  students were handed fresh face masks and asked to sanitise their hands. Examination halls were allowed to accommodate a maximum of 12 candidates at a time to allow social distance.  Students were not permitted to carry anything other than the admit card  ID cards  two passport-size photographs  a sanitiser and a transparent water bottle. The exam concluded at 5 pm.

"A select few gymnasiums resumed their services on Monday morning because owners either were making the necessary arrangements to ensure proper sanitisation and hygiene following the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak  or were unaware of any such order being passed by the Delhi government that has also allowed yoga centres to operate.

All other social distancing and preventive measures such as hand hygiene and thermal screening at the entrance were to be strictly followed by members and gymnasium and yoga organisers.

So far  13 states have communicated their borrowing options and six states have indicated that they would convey their choice next week  they said requesting anonymity.  The six states are Goa  Assam  Arunachal Pradesh  Nagaland  Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh (HP). Also Read: Gold cheaper by Rs 4 800  being sold at a discount despite fall in price At the 41st GST Council on August 27  the Union government gave two borrowing options to states to meet their revenue shortfall of about Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year.  Two days later  it specified that under the first option  states would not have to pay either principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97 000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation bottlenecks.  However  they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfalls due to an “act of God”  which is the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Some states  where opposition parties are in power  such as Delhi  Kerala  Punjab  West Bengal (WB)  Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh  had initially opposed the Centre’s proposal.

Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism that HT had reported on August 31.  Kerala finance minister (FM) Thomas Isaac had tweeted on August 31  “FMs of Punjab  Delhi  WB  Chhattisgarh Telengana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation .Our option: the central government to borrow the entire compensation due regardless of the acts of God  humans or nature   to be paid back by extending the period of cess.” “Initially  many states  where opposition parties in power  had some reservation related to borrowing. Now  they are weighing their options after the Centre has clarified its commitment to pay the entire compensation. They will also communicate their choices soon ” one of the officials quoted above said. On September 3  Union expenditure and revenue secretaries had met virtually with state finance secretaries to explain how the options would work. HT on September 9 had reported that following the Centre’s clarification the only option available to states to receive the GST compensation was to borrow. Most states  including some ruled by parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)  were likely to opt for the first of the two options offered on August 27.  Isaac had tweeted on September 9  “I welcome the new stance of the Centre that it was never its idea to deny full GST compensation. Glad to be corrected. But deferring half the compensation for better times  ipso facto  is deferring public expenditures to better times. It is the surest way of deferring future good days.” At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017  the GST law had assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liqour  cigarettes  aerated water  automobiles  coal and other tobacco products.  States and union territories (UTs) require Rs 3 lakh crore GST compensation in the current financial year  an 82% jump from 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue  as the economy has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions  the officials said. According to an official statement released on July 27  the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1 65 302 crore  while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95 444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20  which is the lowest in 11 years.  The 41st council meeting had taken place in the backdrop of the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) for India on the compensation cess issue  where he had said there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue  the officials said.  According to the AG  the GST Council was expected to find ways to meet the shortfall in compensation and not the Central government. “The GST Council offered two options to the states to borrow ” a second official said. “It was discussed in the recent GST Council meeting that in the current economic scenario it may not be possible to increase tax rates or do rate rationalisation to meet the compensation shortfall. However  borrowing could be an option to address this challenge ” he said. Even former FM Arun Jaitley had categorically stated that  if required  market borrowing could be an option to compensate in case of a shortfall and later the same can be repaid through the future collection of cess. “Fulfilling the same commitment  the Central government has  time and again  stated that the entitlement of the states would always be for full compensation and the entire compensation sum on account of shortfall in collections of GST will be paid and honoured ” he said.

Isaac had tweeted on September 9  “I welcome the new stance of the Centre that it was never its idea to deny full GST compensation. Glad to be corrected. But deferring half the compensation for better times  ipso facto  is deferring public expenditures to better times. It is the surest way of deferring future good days.” At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017  the GST law had assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022) and their revenue shortfall should be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liqour  cigarettes  aerated water  automobiles  coal and other tobacco products.  States and union territories (UTs) require Rs 3 lakh crore GST compensation in the current financial year  an 82% jump from 2019-20 because of a sharp fall in the tax revenue  as the economy has been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resultant 68-day nationwide lockdown restrictions  the officials said. According to an official statement released on July 27  the total amount of compensation paid to states and UTs in 2019-20 was Rs 1 65 302 crore  while the total amount of cess collected in that year was Rs 95 444 crore. The lower revenue collection was primarily due to subdued economic growth. India’s gross domestic product (GDP) had slowed to 4.2% in fiscal 2019-20  which is the lowest in 11 years.  The 41st council meeting had taken place in the backdrop of the opinion of the Attorney General (AG) for India on the compensation cess issue  where he had said there was no obligation on the Centre under the GST laws to compensate for the loss of revenue  the officials said.  According to the AG  the GST Council was expected to find ways to meet the shortfall in compensation and not the Central government. “The GST Council offered two options to the states to borrow ” a second official said. “It was discussed in the recent GST Council meeting that in the current economic scenario it may not be possible to increase tax rates or do rate rationalisation to meet the compensation shortfall. However  borrowing could be an option to address this challenge ” he said. Even former FM Arun Jaitley had categorically stated that  if required  market borrowing could be an option to compensate in case of a shortfall and later the same can be repaid through the future collection of cess. “Fulfilling the same commitment  the Central government has  time and again  stated that the entitlement of the states would always be for full compensation and the entire compensation sum on account of shortfall in collections of GST will be paid and honoured ” he said.

"Andhra Pradesh (AP)   Bihar  Gujarat  Haryana  Karnataka  Madhya Pradesh (MP)  Meghalaya  Sikkim  Tripura  Uttar Pradesh (UP)  Uttarakhand and Odisha have opted for the first borrowing option of Rs 97 000 crore to meet the Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenue shortfall  while Manipur has preferred the second option of a loan of Rs 2.35 lakh crore  two Union finance ministry officials said. So far  13 states have communicated their borrowing options and six states have indicated that they would convey their choice next week  they said requesting anonymity.  The six states are Goa  Assam  Arunachal Pradesh  Nagaland  Mizoram and Himachal Pradesh (HP). Also Read: Gold cheaper by Rs 4 800  being sold at a discount despite fall in price At the 41st GST Council on August 27  the Union government gave two borrowing options to states to meet their revenue shortfall of about Rs 2.35 lakh crore in the current financial year.  Two days later  it specified that under the first option  states would not have to pay either principle or interest if they borrow only Rs 97 000 crore to meet the GST revenue shortfall because of implementation bottlenecks.  However  they would have to bear significant interest costs if they choose the larger borrowing option of Rs 2.35 lakh crore that includes revenue shortfalls due to an “act of God”  which is the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Some states  where opposition parties are in power  such as Delhi  Kerala  Punjab  West Bengal (WB)  Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh  had initially opposed the Centre’s proposal.  Also Read: Andhra govt hikes VAT on natural gas by 10% to offset revenue losses Addressing a press conference on August 30  WB finance minister Amit Mitra had said a huge debt was being thrust on states in the name of “act of God” — a reference to the phrase used by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to describe the Covid-19 pandemic. Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia termed the Centre’s move a “betrayal” of federalism that HT had reported on August 31.  Kerala finance minister (FM) Thomas Isaac had tweeted on August 31  “FMs of Punjab  Delhi  WB  Chhattisgarh Telengana and Kerala agreed to reject the Centre’s options on GST compensation .Our option: the central government to borrow the entire compensation due regardless of the acts of God  humans or nature   to be paid back by extending the period of cess.” “Initially  many states  where opposition parties in power  had some reservation related to borrowing. Now  they are weighing their options after the Centre has clarified its commitment to pay the entire compensation. They will also communicate their choices soon ” one of the officials quoted above said. On September 3  Union expenditure and revenue secretaries had met virtually with state finance secretaries to explain how the options would work.

"Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)  which was once known as the country’s richest civic body  is looking to cut costs this year amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. BMC’s income has taken a hit during the Covid-19-induced lockdown restrictions  as the earnings under several heads such as property and water taxes  development charge etc; have dipped because of the viral outbreak.  It’s expenditures have also risen by around Rs 600 crore because of Covid-19 relief measures  according to the latest available figure.  Last week  BMC’s general body slashed Rs 2 500 crore from the funds allocated to various infrastructure projects in Mumbai such as coastal road  Gargai dam  and road works. The civic body has asked all its departments to slash their revenue expenditure by at least 20%.  BMC has also incurred losses from delayed collection of property  water and sewerage taxes during the lockdown period and also a loss of income in the development plan department.  All departments have been asked to communicate to the accounts department how they plan to reduce their revenue expenditure. The order was issued by the accounts department 10 days ago. Revenue expenditure is the cost incurred by the civic body to keep its machinery running  including establishments and administrative costs  pensions and gratuity  and operations and maintenance costs.  However  the slashing of revenue expenditure will not affect establishment cost  pensions  and corporators’ funds.  “On many instances  it is noticed that departments use this money before the close of the financial year only because it is allocated in the budget ” the circular stated.  In February  the then BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi had presented a budget of Rs 33 441 crore  of which Rs 18 797 crore and 14 637 was revenue and capital expenditures  respectively.  The budget had also enlisted measures to reduce revenue expenditure incurred by the civic body. It had introduced a hiring freeze in a bid save the civic body Rs 250 crore a year. ",mumbai,ht

"Bollywood lovers have missed their favourites’ sartorial updates from airport but the paparazzi are back to flooding social media with fashion styles of the celebrities as they fly down to work. As travel ban lifts amid COVID-19  Bollywood celebrities are back to nailing the airport looks be it Deepika Padukone in neon green ensemble  Kangana Ranaut in six yards of elegance  Vaani Kapoor’s chic vibes in simple shirt and boots or Ranveer Singh’s bizarre outfits. With nothing better to do this quarantine as netizens idly scroll through their social media feeds  the constant criticism or appreciation of the airport looks have returned while Tinsel Town peeps pull off versatile outfits with flamboyance and elan. Some were a visual treat and looked impeccable than ever while some went overboard with their quirkiness in gaudy outfits and landed with a thumbs down reaction. Kangana Ranaut While her coming down to Mumbai was no secret last week as BMC demolished her office on the grounds of structural violations  Kangana did create additional stir with her signature airport look in a saree. Spotted at the Chandigarh airport amid heavy security by CRPF jawaans  Kangana won fashion police’s attention too as she donned a white printed saree teamed with a pearl white blouse having blue border on the sleeves.

"Ashok Soota  a pioneer of India’s information technology services industry  has headed three outsourcing companies including one of the nation’s largest  Wipro Ltd.  and taken two of them public. The second was this week when the initial public offering of his latest startup  Happiest Minds Technologies Ltd.  was oversubscribed 151 times. The IPO got bids for 3.51 billion shares versus the 23.3 million on offer  ranking it among India’s most successful first-time share sales of this decade. “The IPO got a boost from the credibility of the founder ” said Abhimanyu Sofat  head of research at IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “That added to investor confidence and led to institutional and foreign investors wanting a piece of the pie.” Happiest Minds  which gets almost all of its revenue from digital services  is one of two IPOs this week to woo Indian investors. An offering from Route Mobile Ltd.  a cloud infrastructure provider  was oversubscribed 73 times on the last day of the sale on Friday as the frenzy for technology stocks globally rubs off on even the smallest of companies. The huge demand for both the companies bodes well for India’s IPO market  which has seen only two main board offerings in 2020 despite a buoyant stock market. The S&P BSE Sensex is up about 50% from a low in March even as the country saw its worst economic contraction on record in the June quarter and is the new global virus hotspot. “The oversubscription reflects the premium at which most of the Indian market is priced at ” said Deepak Jasani  head of research at HDFC Securities Ltd. “The Happiest Minds IPO pricing was quite reasonable and left something on the table for investors.” Digital Focus The Happiest Minds’ shares were sold in a price range of 165-166 rupees ($2.3) apiece. Soota raised 1.4 billion rupees by selling part of his stake. The sale closed Wednesday and the shares are likely to begin trading next week. Soota  77  founded the Bengaluru-based startup in 2011. The venture followed an acrimonious parting with the co-founders at his previous startup Mindtree Ltd.  which he had taken public in March 2007. That IPO was oversubscribed more than 100 times. Happiest Minds expects to expand at an annualized rate of 20%  almost double the industry growth rate  Soota told BloombergQuint on Sept. 7. The company gets 97% of its revenue from digital services  compared with 30-50% for its local peers  according to a report by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Soota declined to comment to queries from Bloomberg News  citing compliance requirements. ",mumbai,ht

"Actor Kangana Ranaut has resumed her attacks against the Maharashtra government  after leaving Mumbai and arriving in Chandigarh on Monday. Kangana has been engaged in a war of words with the Uddhav Thackeray government  which escalated last week during her Mumbai visit.  In a tweet  Kangana wrote in Hindi  “After landing in Chandigarh  my security has visibly decreased... People are congratulating me. It seems like I survived this time.

"Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut on Sunday apprised Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari of the “unjust treatment” she received following her criticism of Mumbai Police in connection with the force’s probe into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. A war of words broke out between the actor and the ruling Shiv Sena after Ranaut compared Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir and saying she does not feel safe in the city.

I have no connection with politics. I presented my thoughts as a commoner ” Ranaut said. Her comments come amid speculations that she might join politics. * Will face all political storms: Uddhav Thackeray In an apparent reference to political criticism over the Shiv Sena’s tussle with Ranaut  Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said he was ready to face all political storms. “I will have to remove the mask of the chief minister to respond to politics.

He termed the entire row a ‘conspiracy’ to defame Mumbai. Raut named actor Akshay Kumar in the column  questioned the silence of the Bollywood fraternity as he compared the film industry to the Pandavas who remained silent when Draupadi was being disrobed. *Sena accuses BJP leaders in Maharashtra of helping ‘outsiders’ vilify Mumbai’s image “Once again the efforts to vilify the image of Maharashtra’s capital Mumbai have begun. These attempts are made by the ‘outsiders’. But  as per tradition  the moles inside our own house are to make them stronger. In the intervening period  Mumbai was called Pakistan. BMC was referred to as ‘Babar’ after the municipal corporation took action on the illegal construction of an actress (Kangana Ranaut) who insulted Mumbai ” Raut wrote in his article in Saamana. * Y-plus security cover for Ranaut on her father’s request: Union minister Ranaut  who will be returning to Manali on September 14  has been provided with Y-plus security cover following her father’s request to the Himachal Pradesh government  Union minister of state for home G Kishan Reddy has said.

"The Bombay High Court (HC) on Tuesday directed Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities to file an affidavit regarding the cause behind a frequent collapse of retention walls by various property developers that caused several fatalities and injuries to poor construction workers over the past three years. The two-member HC bench  comprising Justices SJ Kathawalla and Riyaz Chagla  also directed PMC authorities to explain its reasons behind permitting the developers to proceed with their projects without approving structural stability of such walls. The civic body has also been asked to state in its affidavit whether it had taken adequate steps to ensure that the retention walls constructed by developers for their ongoing projects were in conformity with the accepted safety norms. The court gave its order while hearing three petitions filed by Alcon Group  a property  developer  challenging the stop work notices issued by PMC following the Kondhwa wall collapse on June 29  2019. The tragedy had claimed the lives of 15 construction workers  including two women and four children  after a retention wall collapsed on their makeshift shanties at the project site. Alcon Group prayed before the court that it should be allowed to carry out construction activities at other projects because they were in no way linked to the Kondhwa incident. The bench will hear the petitions next on September 22. Earlier last November  the court had struck down the stop work order issued by PMC in July 2019 for the Aspiree project  which Alcon Group had jointly undertaken with Kunal Housing  and allowed the construction activities to be completed.

The civic body has also been asked to state in its affidavit whether it had taken adequate steps to ensure that the retention walls constructed by developers for their ongoing projects were in conformity with the accepted safety norms. The court gave its order while hearing three petitions filed by Alcon Group  a property  developer  challenging the stop work notices issued by PMC following the Kondhwa wall collapse on June 29  2019. The tragedy had claimed the lives of 15 construction workers  including two women and four children  after a retention wall collapsed on their makeshift shanties at the project site. Alcon Group prayed before the court that it should be allowed to carry out construction activities at other projects because they were in no way linked to the Kondhwa incident. The bench will hear the petitions next on September 22. Earlier last November  the court had struck down the stop work order issued by PMC in July 2019 for the Aspiree project  which Alcon Group had jointly undertaken with Kunal Housing  and allowed the construction activities to be completed.

" Starting with the “new normal” guidelines  all market places in the city have resumed backed operations.  One of the oldest  and a bell-whether for small business operations in the city - Tulshibaug market – has 800 shop owners and registered hawkers lining Bajirao road  in the heart of the city.  The market first opened on June 1 under the odd-even rule  but since has gradually resumed operations in full.  Haribhau Kavare  owner of Kavare ice-creams  a landmark for shoppers visiting the area  said  “Traders  shop-owners and hawkers in the market are still suffering due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Business has dropped drastically  for us it has almost gone down by 90 per cent. Earlier  daily we used to earn between Rs 8 000 and Rs 10 000. Now it is Rs 1 000. We had 10 workers at our shop  but as there are no customers  we only have two.”  Jewellery  cosmetics  clothes  children’s wear and household items are the Tulshibaug staples. The market is closed on Monday.  Jewellery shop owner  Jeetendra Ambasankar  said  “Since the market has opened  there are no customers  as such. We only allow one person in the shop at a time to maintain social distancing. We are focusing on the online trading option  as we have our customer data and send them our items on WhatsApp. We do delivery as well. There is hardly 25 per cent of business happening  as compared to before the lockdown.”  Pravin Patil  owner of a women’s clothes shop  said  “Tulshibaug is famous for a variety of products available at a cheap rate. So people  especially women  used to come from far here for shopping. All this has stopped now. Only people from the area come for shopping and that too  for basic items. The market is open  but the business has not grown. There are very few customers  even on weekends.”  HT visited the market on a Sunday and Patil’s testimony to “not much crowd”  bears witness.  The once-was-no-space-to-walk era in Tulshibaug seems long gone .  Dhanashree Khole  30  a resident of Sadashiv peth  out on a Sunday  said  “I have never seen Tulshibaug market so empty. It is all due to Covid-19. Even we were afraid to come to the market  but as we had to purchase clothes for my son I had to visit the market  taking all the safety precautions.”  Another shopper  Jeetendra Bhagwat  aged 42 came in from Swargate. He said  “As we get many varieties of household products and that too  at an affordable price  I always prefer to come to Tulshibaug for shopping.”  Both the shoppers wore face masks and were ensuring a social distance while in the market.

"Driven by a surge in Covid-19 cases in the last few days  Pune has become the first district in the country to record more than two lakh cases. As per data of the Maharashtra government’s health department  the total number of Covid-19 cases in Pune district reached 2 03 468 on Monday after 4 165 more people tested positive for the disease. Officials here said increased testing was one of the main reasons for the surge in cases in the district. Pune crossed the one lakh-mark on August 5 and in a month’s time  the cases have doubled in the district  according to official figures. Compared to Pune  Delhi reported 1 93 526 Covid-19 cases till Monday  while Mumbai recorded 1 57 410 cases. The Covid-19 positivity rate in Pune is around 22 per cent  Collector Rajesh Deshmukh told PTI on Tuesday. “Currently  Pune district is on top in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases in the country. The reason behind thesurge in cases is the aggressive testing strategy adopted by the district administration ” he said. Not just recently  but Pune has been doing aggressive testing for the last two months and the number of cases is bound to increase  he said. “In fact  no other district is conducting tests the way Pune is doing ” he claimed. Effective contact-tracing  tracking of co-morbid people and isolation of patients have been possible due to the large number of tests  Deshmukh said. “Testing  tracking and tracing are the main factors behind the surge. Even the results of sero survey (conducted on nearly 1 500 people) found out that 50 per cent people had antibodies ” he said. Despite the number of Covid-19 cases being high  the recovery rate in Pune is encouraging as it is now about 78 per cent  he said. According to the district administration records  over 1.57 lakh patients have so far been discharged or have recovered from the disease. Till Monday  4 651 deaths due to Covid-19 were reported in Pune as against 7 897 in Mumbai. Deshmukh said the fatality rate in Pune is around 2.3 per cent  which is better compared to Mumbai. “Our aim is to further bring down the fatality rate by detecting co-morbid patients at an early stage ” he said. District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar saidthe number of cases will further rise in the coming days. “From today  we are setting up camps in 65 villages where more than 15 cases have been reported. Rapid antigen tests will be conducted on a large population there and as a result  the number of cases will go up ” Pawar said. Deshmukh said besides aggressive testing  the administration is stressing on awareness  strict implementation of social distancing norms and use of masks. “Considering the rise in cases  there is an emphasis on strengthening healthcare facilities in Pune city and in the district  and medical teams have also been set up to screen people aged above 60 having co-morbid conditions ” he added. While the district administration has claimed that health care facilities have been strengthened  there have been complaints about unavailability of beds in hospitals and other medical aids. Two jumbo facilities in Pune city and neighbouring Pimpri Chinchwad industrial area were opened last month. But  the functioning of the facility in Pune came under scanner after allegations of lapses and mismanagement there. Pune-based Congress leader and former MLC Mohan Joshi blamed the BJP-led Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for the increase in number of Covid-19 cases in the city. “The BJP is in power in the PMC with a strength of 100 corporators. Besides  Girish Bapat of the BJP is a Lok Sabha member from Pune and five MLAs in the city are from the saffron party. Union minister Prakash Javadekar is from Pune  and despite all this  the situation in the city has become critical ” Joshi said. However  BJP MLA Siddharth Shirole  who represents Shivajinagar constituency in Pune  said the number of Covid-19 cases is bound to go up as testing has been increased. “Our thrust should be on bringing the mortality rate down and for that efforts need to be made ” he said.

" The Pune traffic police have not reported any drink driving cases since April  when the lockdown had been implemented which in turn resulted in closure of bars and restaurants.  However  the first case of fatal drink driving was reported on Sunday from Balewadi when retired police inspector Sanjay Nikam mowed down a worker under the wheels of his car in an inebriated condition.  Also read: Drink driving: One-day police custody for retired inspector for killing one in Pune The accident which occurred at Mamata Square in Balewadi left four others injured. Nikam (58) was arrested by Chatuhshrungi police and charged with culpable homicide. Nikam during his service with the city police has worked with the Social Security Cell (SSC) and traffic control branch.  According to the data available with the traffic branch  as many as 752 drink driving cases have been lodged across different divisions between January and March this year  however  this stopped as soon as the lockdown was invoked. Joint commissioner (law and order) Ravindra Shisve said  “No action has been taken in relation of drink driving cases since the Covid outbreak.”  In 2019  a total of 13 239 cases of drink driving were reported in the city.  Last year  six traffic divisions - Koregaon Park  Wanowrie  Aiport  Hadapsar  Warje and Bharati Vidyapeeth emerged at the top with the highest number of drink driving cases between January 1  2019 and December 22  2019. As many as 13 239 cases have been registered in 2019 in all the 24 traffic divisions under Pune police commissionerate. The highest number of cases - 2 702 - had been registered in April 2019.  The city traffic police had booked offenders after they were found driving under the influence of alcohol through various methods  like breath analysing tests  nakabandi at various spots and surprise checks outside pubs and hotels. In a drive launched by the traffic police  drivers of heavy vehicles were also checked. Action was taken against offenders under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Act  which states that alcohol content legal limit is 0.03% to 30 micro litre in 100 ml blood.  Traffic experts expect the same type of crackdown in 2020 to prevent incidents of fatalities which have started after reopening of the city.  Pedestrian First convener Prashant Inamdar  said  “Enforcement is on the lower side due to the Covid crisis and police presence is also less which was not the case in the past. With CCTV  there is surveillance  but physical presence of police officials is missing. The presence of policemen is the need of the hour as we are going back to normalcy and strict enforcement on all counts has to be restored to prevent incidents like drink driving which cause fatalities.”  ",pune,ht
