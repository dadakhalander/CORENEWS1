0, Unregistered villas  flats and apartments that are being pitched to tourists as affordable accommodation  across the state have become a thorn in the side for legitimate hoteliers  homestays and bed and breakfasts across the state as they have been losing considerable business to these illegal ventures.  These unregistered guest houses are being rented through online travel companies and through touts. Tourists  too  prefer to put up at these accommodations due to the cheap tariff. Most of these accommodations only charge ₹500 to ₹1 000 per room during the off season. Registered hoteliers cannot hope to compete with the prices as the illegal ventures do not pay tax and use domestic water and power connections.  With business being encroached  occupancy in registered businesses is around 10% during weekdays and increases to 15%-20% during the weekends. A large number of illegal guest houses have mushroomed around the state capital.  The tourism department says there are around 3 350 registered hotels and 1 656 registered homestays in the state. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth says   “Due to these unregistered accommodations  tourists are unwilling to pay even 50% tariff in the off season. This is a big blow for budget-class hotels  bread and breakfasts and home stays. It has become difficult to sustain hotels due to low- occupancy in hotels.” “The government does not get any tax from these unregistered accommodations  which causes losses to the government also ” he said.  Hoteliers claim that it has become difficult for them to meet fixed expenditures such as staff salaries  electricity bills  water bills and garbage-collection fee.  The industry is already reeling in the aftermath of the Covid crisis. Apart from a six-month waiver on fixed demand charges levied on hotels by Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board Limited no other financial help has been extended to the hotel industry. The government has also announced an interest subvention scheme for the hotel industry  under which working capital will be provided to hotels but this has proved to be an eye wash as none of the hotelier benefitted from the scheme  due to stringent norms. Banks are reluctant to sanction loans to hoteliers under the scheme.Rebate in property tax and waiver of garbage fee for the period when the hotels were completely closed is still awaited.  Travel agents out of job Travel Chapter Anil Bhardwaj senior vice-president said travel agents were not getting any business. “Unless  Volvo bus service and flights are not resumed and train connectivity from Bengal  Maharashtra  Delhi and Gujarat is not streamlined. Travel agents cannot expect any business. Moreover  online travel companies are also eating into travel agents’ business.”  “The government should restart Volvos and ask the railways to restore of all train routes up to Kalka and Chandigarh at the earliest to save the travel and tourism industry ” he said. Hoteliers and tourism stakeholders do not expect the tourism and hospitality sectors to normalise before the summer and are seeking financial aid from the government. They have demanded that the  government announce a special package  which includes domestic tariff for water  garbage-collection fee  property tax  waiver of fixed demand charges on electricity bills for at least one year and unconditional and collateral-free financial assistance in the shape of working capital loan to all hotels through state cooperative banks.  ,delhi,ht

3, A student of Delhi University’s Lady Shri Ram College recently died by suicide owing to the stress of not getting her scholarship on time  and because of online classes being an economic burden on her family. During the entire pandemic  students have been trying to cope with what the new normal seems to be for them  ranging from online classes  travelling in the pandemic to appear for exams and constant tussle with occupancy of rooms in hostels.  “Honestly  we are really tired of raising our voices for the problems we have been facing. Whether it’s online open book exams or online classes  students have been protesting against it all. Some of our parents have lost jobs. They aren’t in a position to support our education  leave alone buy us a new laptop for us to be able to attend online classes. My friends who live in villages  don’t have WiFi or internet connectivity  as it’s available in the city. Despite all this  we all have persisted in coping with digital learning. Glued to the screen for six hours a day  we are under mental stress  and it’s time that people take cognisance of the load of online assignments  online exams  and many other challenges that we are facing ” says Amrutha V Devan  a student of Miranda House college  Delhi University. An LSR stu died by suicide because she couldn’t afford her edu. This normalisation of institutional murders and discrimination is appalling! Edu is still inaccessible to millions. And if we manage to secure a seat  we’re made to give up on our dreams and sometimes our lives too.. Recently  entrance exams that were conducted for various colleges and courses required the students to travel from their home towns to the designated examination centres. “I had to travel in the pandemic to give the Delhi University Entrance Test (DUET)  and my centre was Chandigarh. My journey from Delhi to Chandigarh was full of fear. I had mask  gloves and sanitiser  but the constant worry about staying in a hotel  eating outside food  and travelling at the risk of contracting the virus was a huge mental stress for me. But what other way did I have?” says Sanjay Kataria  a masters student of Department of Library and Information Science  DU. A girl from LSR   DU commits suicide on 3rd Nov . She was a state topper beside being gareeb. Her family was financially struggling but still they leased their house to provide her few cent so that she could survive in Delhi to carry on her studies and fulfill her dreams . Financial burden owing to layoffs in the pandemic is further adding to woes of many youngsters. “My father is a cancer patient  and my mother’s rented grocery shop is the only source of income. I cannot afford the expenses of online classes and even my college fee at the moment. My ambition is to join the civil service and to achieve my dream I need to continue my studies in Delhi. My family has a lot of hope from me but everything seems so difficult because of the economic condition we are in “ says Lekshmy A R  a student of Zakir Husain Delhi College  DU. The amount of mental stress that students are going through is due to various reasons. Vedha Chopra  a psychologist at Manas Foundation  says  “Students currently are undergoing a lot of stress during the pandemic. The ones who appeared for entrances  did so during the lockdown under novel and difficult circumstances. College students are having difficulty adjusting to the online method of attending classes. Some of them don’t even have the devices to support this medium of education and those who do have  need to adapt to sitting patiently in front of a screen and concentrate for hours at a stretch. This format of learning is something that they have never been exposed to before.”  Chopra opines that youngsters who are unable to meet friends  who are a support system for them are further distressed. “Home is another aspect of normalcy that has been taken away from students’ daily lives. Friendships are an important contributor towards factors such as healthy cognitive development  and for fostering skills such as empathy  conflict resolution and decision making ” she adds.

4,Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said the national capital has hit the peak of the third wave of Covid-19 and the number of cases suggests it has been the worst so far. The government has increased the number of beds for Covid-19 patients in hospitals in Delhi  but there is no plan to rope in hotels and banquet halls  the minister said. “The third wave of Covid-19 is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon ” Jain said. The minister attributed the increase in the number of cases to aggressive testing and contact-tracing. He  however  said laxity on the part of the people has been a major reason behind the spike in new cases. “Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don’t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for Covid-19 till a vaccine is developed ” Jain added. ,delhi,ht
5,The air quality index (AQI) in the national capital on Sunday morning remained in the severe category for the fourth consecutive day  despite a marginal improvement. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data showed that the AQI was 405 at 7 am on Sunday.  An AQI between 401 and 500 is considered to be severe  which causes distress and respiratory complications  especially for children and senior citizens.  On Thursday  Friday and Saturday  Delhi’s average 24-hour AQI stood at 450  406 and 427  respectively.  Scientists have predicted that the relief from bad air is unlikely till Tuesday (November 10).  Over 4 500 farm fires that are raging in neighbouring Haryana and Punjab contributed to around 32% of ultrafine particulate matter (PM 2.5)  which could not be dispersed  in Delhi’s air despite slightly better wind speed on Saturday  as compared to Friday.  VK Soni  the head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) environment monitoring research centre  said that during the day the average wind speed was around 12 kilometres per hour (kmph)  which was higher than that on Friday.  However  its impact was not seen on the AQI because of an increase in stubble burning cases in Haryana and Punjab. He said that the north-westerly winds are bringing a heavy load of pollutants from these farm fires to the national capital.  “For the last three days we have been observing that the number of farm fires spotted over Punjab alone is over 4 000. Usually  these fires go up on Sundays at this time of the year. Though the wind speed picked up during the day  the improvement in air quality was not all that significant only because of an uptick in farm fire cases ” Soni said.  Kuldeep Srivastava  the head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre  said that in parts of central Delhi the wind speed fluctuated between six and eight kmph on Saturday  but the corresponding figure was up to 16 kmph in outer parts of the national capital.  “The wind is blowing from the north-western direction  which is bringing a large share of smoke from Haryana and Punjab ” he said. Srivastava said that there is a forecast of the wind direction changing to easterlies from Tuesday  but before that it will reduce drastically  possibly pushing the city’s air quality further into the “severe” zone.  “During the transitional stage of a change in wind direction  the speed reduces drastically. The wind may become calm from Sunday evening. This will only lead to a further worsening of air quality ” he warned.  IMD had predicted a foggy Sunday morning in the national capital. The maximum and minimum temperature is expected to be around 30 degrees and 11 degrees Celsius (C)  respectively.  On Saturday  Delhi’s minimum temperature  recorded at the Safdarjung observatory  was 11.8 degrees C – two degrees below normal. The maximum temperature was 30 degrees C – one degree above normal.  ,delhi,ht
6,The HT Brunch Social Media Star Of The Week goes to the butter chicken chef who’s now famous for so much more: Saransh Goila. Why? For driving non-stop for 20 hours (as a social distancing move) from Mumbai to Delhi to spend time with his mum  who has an autoimmune disease. And for making a feast out of it as a social media series.  Mama’s little chef “I first came to Delhi for two weeks as lockdown restrictions began to be eased  but I didn’t cook much then. I let my mother do the pampering ” says Saransh. The big hit was his Instagram video documenting old-fashioned Indian kitchen tools that his mother uses efficiently even today. “All of what we did was spontaneous. I didn’t expect the video to become such a hit ” the #Sadakchef  as he is sometimes called on social media  tells us. “We made a lot of Sindhi food. Mum showed me how to use lotus stem in different ways  and we cooked cholai ka saag in a lohe ki kadhai!” Saransh inherits his camera-friendly demeanour from his mum. “Mom enjoys being in front of the camera as much as I do. I’m especially connected to my mother because of what I do  but my inspiration has also been my granddad  who was a great cook.” Family first “A year ago  my mother was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis  and that’s when I started coming to Delhi more often ” says Saransh. “My mother is mentally strong  works on her lungs  does a lot of exercises. Seeing her deal with it positively makes us stronger.” Saransh may have put himself on the map by being the “marathon runner” who’s also the chef who serves butter chicken. But his recent posts show that deep in his heart  is Sindhi food. “Sindhi food comes with the story of Partition  and my nanaji lived through it ” he says. “It’s a cuisine that cares a lot about slow cooking. We bhoono a lot  that’s why Sindhi food is brown in colour. A lot of our food is also fried  which is a preservation technique. It fills you in such a way that you don’t have to eat a lot of meals.” Why do we not see a lot of Sindhi restaurants? “Because people go out for an experience  while Sindhi cuisine is about food. I think Sindhi food would work wonderfully for delivery. It’s something I’d want to do.” Follow @JamalShaikh on Twitter and Instagram From HT Brunch  November 8  2020 Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch ,delhi,ht

As part of the new guidelines  an age restriction on the pilgrims is likely  the ministry said.  Online registration for the pilgrimage began on Saturday and is set to close on December 10  minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said.

8,The ₹2.35 lakh crore estimated shortfall in Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections in 2020-21 is expected to shrink by almost 15% with revenue seeing positive growth since September and the momentum expected to continue in the remaining five months of the financial year  two finance ministry officials said. Overall GST collections that saw their positive growth (this financial year) of 4% in September  after having plunged by 72% in March  posted a year-on-year growth of over 10% in October  when they crossed ₹1.05 lakh crore. The October number added to the raft of good news about the economy  including car sales and a strong Purchase Manager’s Index score  an indication of a pick up in manufacturing activity.  Besides positive GST collections since September  the number of states having a year-on-year decline in revenue has reduced from 15 in September to seven in October  the officials added on condition of anonymity. “The trend  if sustained in the next five months  will reduce the gap between projected revenue and actual revenue for FY-21 by about ₹35 000 crore ” one of the officials said.  According to official data  15 regions that saw a fall in revenue in September 2020 compared to the same month last year included Chandigarh (10% drop in GST revenue)  Delhi (7%)  Sikkim (49%)  Arunachal Pradesh (20%)  Manipur (19%)  Mizoram (42%)  Tripura (3%)  Meghalaya (6%)  Daman and Diu (83%)  Karnataka (5%)  Goa (23%)  Lakshadweep (58%)  Puducherry (1%)  and Telangana (2%).  And growth in revenue collections in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra was stagnant. The year-on-year revenue collections contracted only in seven regions in October this year  including in Chandigarh (3%)  Delhi (8%)  Sikkim (5%)  Daman and Diu (91%)  Lakshadweep (55%)  and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (42%).  “It is expected that the collections November onward would be even better  which would not only reduce the estimated shortfall of ₹2.35 lakh crore [in 2020-21]  but also see improved collections of compensation cess  therefore  proportionately reduce the borrowing liabilities ” the second official said. At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime  the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual tax revenue for five years ending June 30  2022 and the Centre committed to meet any shortfall in revenue through the cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor  cigarettes  aerated water  automobiles  coal and other tobacco commodities. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent 68-day lockdown since March 25  GST collections fell sharply in April and continued to contract till August. On August 27  the Centre gave states the choice of borrowing ₹97 000 crore (the shortfall resulting from GST implementation issues) without having to pay principal or interest  or the entire ₹2.35 lakh crore revenue deficit from the indirect tax (including that arising from the Covid-19 pandemic) projected for this fiscal year. The ₹97 000 crore amount was subsequently raised to ₹1.1 lakh crore on October 5. Seven states are still opposing the Centre’s proposal and are demanding full compensation of ₹2.35 lakh crore under the first option. MS Mani  a partner at consulting firm Deloitte India  said: “With the increase in GST collections for the past two months and an expectation of robust collections in the next few months  the collections deficit is expected to be lower – both in respect of GST and in respect of compensation cess. This could potentially reduce the borrowing plans of the states. The easing of revenue pressures may also enable a renewed focus on the policy agenda by the GST Council.” Archit Gupta  founder and CEO of the financial technology platform ClearTax  said: “Judging from the overall growth rate of the past three months  it looks like the economy is on the road to recovery  and one can expect to see a marginal increase month-on-month over the next few months of the financial year.” ,delhi,ht
9, With the Himachal BJP reeling from factionalism  chief minister Jai Ram Thakur met national party chief Jagat Prakash Nadda in New Delhi on Saturday. Thakur had also held a closed-door meeting with state party chief Suresh Kashyap on Friday evening at Peterhoff Hotel. The leaders are said to have discussed the issues plaguing the party and the upcoming elections to panchayati raj institutions.  Kashyap also discussed in detail factionalism in the party  particularly in the Jawalamukhi segment  where senior party legislator Ramesh Dhawala is up in arms against the party’s decision to dissolve the block unit. Kashyap had dissolved the unit after fresh infighting erupted among Dhawala supporters and the party’s organisational secretary Pawan Rana. Dhawala has repeatedly accused Rana of interfering in the Jawalamukhi segment. Dhawala had termed the party’s action as arbitrary. He has sought intervention of national BJP chief Jagat Prakash Nadda to redress his grievances.  “After the Bihar elections  Nadda should devote two to three days to asses the situation in Himachal and Jawalamukhi  in particular ” said Dhawala  who also spoke to former chief minister Shanta Kumar.  There is growing disquiet in the party over infighting in Jawalamukhi  as it believes that it will tarnish the party’s image. The party can hardly sideline Dhawala who Dhawala was instrumental in formation of the BJP- Himachal Vikas Congress (HVP) alliance government in 1998. Dhawala  then an independent candidate  had enabled the BJP to topple the Virbhadra Singh-led Congress government. Dhawala enjoys considerable support among the dominant OBCs (other backward classes).  Braced for panchayat polls Nadda assessed the political situation along with the government and party’s preparation for the upcoming elections to civic bodies and Panchayati Raj Institutions. The elections  which are due next month  are being seen as a precursor to the 2022 assembly elections. The outcome of the elections will be reflective of the policies and programmes of the Jai Ram-led government  which will complete three years in office in December. The Congress has also fortified its cadres and is attacking the government over misrule  poor governance and questionable fiscal management. Congress leaders during their rallies and speeches have been condemning Jai Ram’s anti-people stance. The BJP is banking on the party’s three-year rule and the achievements of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre. The BJP has directed its workers to educate voters about the benefits of different centrally-sponsored schemes. The BJP will also attempt to derive political mileage from the newly carved out municipal corporations in Mandi  Palampur and Solan. Mandi is also the home town of the chief minister while Palampur is the home town of former chief minister Shanta Kumar.  ,delhi,ht
10, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has appealed to residents to avoid firecrackers in view of the possible second wave of Covid.  Mohol said  “The central government team that visited Pune has stated of a possible second surge of Covid cases in December and January. As bursting of firecrackers cause respiratory-related problem  it also generate aerosols which may transmit Covid virus more rapidly. Some states have already taken a decision to ban firecrackers during Diwali. Hence  citizens on their own need to take necessary care and avoid firecrackers this seson.”  The mayor said that as the Mumbai municipal corporation has taken some decisions regarding firecrackers  the Pune counterpart has sought the details and could issue guidelines likewise.  “I request traders and kids who burst crackers during the festival  mainly on Laxmi Puja  to keep it at a minimum level as it will badly affect those with respiratory issues ” he said.  A civic official on condition of anonymity said  “With many restrictions already in place due to the Covid situation  we have only made a public appeal to avoid use of crackers instead of banning it. As it is  there is no mechanism to check citizens using firecrackers during the festival.”  Meanwhile  the civic administration has already put in place many checks and guidelines for crackers sellers to put up roadside stalls in an effort to bring down supply numbers.  NCP demands ban on cracker sale  Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) spokesperson Ankush Kakade has demanded the state ban on sale of firecrackers in view of the Covid situation. Kakade has written to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to take the decision as carried out by Delhi and other states.  ,delhi,ht
11,Delhi’s air quality remained in the severe zone for the third consecutive day on Saturday  with over 4 500 farm fires in Punjab and Haryana contributing to over 32% of ultrafine particulate matter (PM2.5) which could not be dispersed despite slightly better wind speed compared to Friday  scientists said  warning that a relief was unlikely at least till Tuesday.  The average air quality index of Delhi was 427 on Saturday  marginally higher than Friday’s 406 but less than Thursday (450).     VK Soni  head of India Meteorological Department (IMD) environment monitoring research centre said that during the day the average wind speed was around 12kmph  which was higher than the wind speed recorded on Friday. Its impact  however  was not seen on the AQI because of the high stubble burning cases in Punjab and Haryana. He said that the north-westerly winds are bringing heavy load of pollutants from these fires to Delhi.  “For the last three days we have been observing that the number of fires spotted over Punjab alone is more than 4 000  and that it tends to increase on Sundays. Even though the wind speed picked up during the day  the improvement in air quality was not very significant only because of higher share of farm fires ” Soni said.  According to the union ministry of earth sciences’ air quality monitoring centre  System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar)  4 528 fires were spotted over Punjab and Haryana  on Saturday.  Kuldeep Srivastava  head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre  said that in parts of central Delhi the wind speed fluctuated between 6-8kmph  but around outer Delhi the wind speed picked up to 16kmph.  “In the Palam observatory  the wind speed was nearly 16kmph  but if you look at the winds recorded in the Safdarjung observatory  it was only around 6-8kmph. This could be the reason behind the high pollution in the heart of the city. The wind that we are receiving now is from the north-western direction  which is bringing a large share of smoke from Punjab and Haryana ” said Srivastava.  Srivastava said that there is a forecast of the wind direction changing to easterlies from Tuesday  but before that wind speed will reduce drastically  possibly pushing the city’s air quality further into the ‘severe’ zone.  “When the wind direction changes  in the transitional stage the wind speeds reduce drastically and from Sunday evening the wind may become calm. This will only spell more trouble for Delhi ” Srivastava warned.  Saturday was the third consecutive day when the AQI in the national capital crossed the severe mark. CPCB data shows that last year  there were 24 days when the air quality plunged into the ‘severe’ category. In 2018  there were 20 such days and in 2017  there were nine days when the AQI levels remained in the red zone.  Senior CPCB officials said that even though the city’s AQI levels has remained in the ‘severe’ zone for three days now  late Thursday night the PM 2.5 levels (ultrafine particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 micrometres) had dipped below the 300ug/m3 mark. For the city to slip into the ‘severe plus’ category  PM 2.5 levels have to consistently remain above the 300ug/m3 mark and PM 10 levels (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers) have to be above the 500ug/m3 mark for 48 hours.  Under such a situation  the CPCB’s taskforce would declare an air emergency and direct all enforcement agencies in Delhi-NCR to bring about measures such as restriction of trucks into the city  stopping construction activities and directing the government to announce the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme under the Graded Response Action Plan (Grap).  ,delhi,ht
12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday said technology and innovation would play a major role in the post-Covid-19 world as he urged graduating Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi students to identify with the aspirations of the common people in the context of the government’s Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India) campaign.  “The post-Covid-19 world is going to be very different and technology has to play a major role in it. Covid-19 has changed the way things are being conducted today. Virtual reality and augmented reality are becoming the working reality now...it has taught us while globalisation is important  self-reliance is equally important. Today  a favourable environment has been created for the implementation of the ideas and innovation of technocrats and to scale them and market them easily. The country is now committed to giving you the ease of doing business so that you can work on providing ease of living to your countrymen through your ideas and innovations ” the Prime Minister said in his address as the chief guest at IIT Delhi’s 51st annual convocation ceremony  via video conferencing.  Modi urged the students to work towards finding solutions to the country’s existing problems. “Indians have immense faith in technology… There are immense possibilities for you in the country and there are immense challenges confronting the country for which you can give solutions. A lot of work can be done in areas such as disaster management  maintaining the groundwater level  solar power generation  telemedicine  and big data analysis. I can place before you several other examples of the country’s needs ” he said.  Modi added that the challenges could be addressed with innovations  new ideas  and efforts…“That is why it is my request to identify with the aspirations of the common people in the context of Atamnirbanar Bharat.”  Modi asked the students to try to turn the adversity into opportunity amid the pandemic. “You may be feeling your batch is not lucky. I am sure you are asking why did this happen with our graduating batch. But think of it differently. You have a first-mover advantage. You have more time to learn and adapt to the new norms emerging in the workplace and beyond. So  make the most of it and look on the brighter side too ” he said.  The Prime Minister gave four mantras to the students for their workplace. Focus on quality  never compromise  ensure scalability; make your innovations work at a mass scale. assure reliability; build long-term trust in the market and bring in adaptability; be open to change and expect uncertainty as a way of life.  Modi asked the students to continue challenging themselves. “It is important that one keeps challenging oneself and continues to learn every day. It is also important that you treat yourself as a student for life.

13,With Delhi reporting nearly 7 000 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday  the number of active cases or those with current infections crossed the 40 000 mark for the first time in the city as the “third wave” of the pandemic infection rages.  A day after the number of new cases in Delhi breached the 7 000-mark for the time  the capital reported 6 953 cases of the infection on Saturday  as per the Delhi government’s daily Covid bulletin.  Also  according to the bulletin  there were 40 258 people living with the infection in the city as on Friday night with the experts warning further spike in cases due to more violation of Covid norms in the ongoing festive season. On Saturday  Delhi reported 79 deaths due to the infection  the highest since July 4 when 81 deaths – some that had happened before – were added to the city’s toll.The total number of fatalities stood at 6912. As per data shared by the union health ministry  Delhi topped the list of 10 states that contributed 77% of the new Covid-19 cases. The Delhi high court had earlier this week said Delhi was on its way to become the “corona capital of the country.”  “The number of cases is likely to continue to go up during the festive season as people tend to have gatherings. The problem is that people tend to get relaxed with their relatives around and do not follow safety measures. People eat together with their masks off at a distance less than 6 feet. Nowadays  even outdoors masks have become chin accessories. Add to that the increase in the levels of pollution  which is also known to increase the severity and transmission of the infection ” said Dr Shobha Broor  former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.  Following Delhi’s second surge in cases of the viral infection in September  the number of active cases was on a decline to just over 20 000 recorded on October 12. Since then  the active cases have almost doubled. The government is concerned about the active cases as these are the people who either need to be constantly monitored at home or need to be hospitalised.  With over 19.5% of the patients with current infections needing hospitalisation  the health bulletin showed that 7 858 people were admitted across city hospitals as on Friday night. Despite having over 16 000 beds earmarked for the treatment of the viral infection in government as well as private hospitals  the intensive care unit beds are filling up fast.  Over 80% of all the ICU beds reserved for Covid-19 treatment were occupied as on Saturday night  according to data shared by hospitals on Delhi Corona app. The government ordered eight of its hospitals and 14 private ones to earmark 1 185 more beds for the treatment of Covid-19 on Friday.  Of these  at least 110 beds in the government hospitals will have non-invasive ventilation or high flow nasal oxygen support.  The national capital is currently reeling under the “third wave” of the Covid-19 infection  but cases should begin to come down soon  Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Saturday. Interacting with reporters  he also said that the Delhi government has filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court after the high court did not allow reserving 80 per cent ICU beds for Covid-19 patients at several private hospitals Jain said  “Yesterday  we issued an order to add 1 185 beds for Covid patients in both Delhi government hospitals and many private hospitals.Five hundred beds are to be augmented at city government-run Covid facilities  including 110 ICU beds.” Dr Sandeep Budhiraja  group medical director  Max healthcare  said  “The hospital occupancy has undoubtedly shot up and is likely to go up further. There is an increasing burden on critical care and hospitals are stretched thin. As per government’s data there are several beds vacant in government hospitals  these could be upgraded to provide critical care as most of the Covid-19 patients coming to hospitals need it. Those with mild symptoms prefer to remain in home isolation.”  The number of deaths have gone up along with the increasing number of cases in the city. On average  just over 57 deaths were reported each day over the last seven days as compared to almost 41 deaths the week before.  However  with huge number of cases being reported  the case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among total positive cases – has reduced to 1.6%. This is still higher than the national average of 1.4%.  “And  if the number of hospitalisations keep going up and there is a shortage of beds  the mortality is likely to go up as people in need of critical care might not get it on time ” said Dr Budhiraja.  ,delhi,ht

20,The national capital has hit the peak of the third wave of COVID-19  and the number of cases suggests that it has been the worst since the pandemic arrived in the city  Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Sunday. He said the government had no plans yet to rope in hotels and banquet halls to augment the bed capacity for COVID-19 patients as the AAP dispensation had increased the number of beds in hospitals of Delhi.

Mask is the only medicine for COVID-19 till a vaccine is developed ” he added.

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat  while announcing his decision to grant bail to the accused  wrote: “Take your freedom from the cage you are in; / Till the trial is over  the state is reined in; / The State proclaims; to have the cake and eat it too; / The Court comes calling; / Before the cake is eaten  bake it too.” ASJ Rawat was deciding the bail application of the accused  one Babu  who has a criminal history  and who was arrested for a gunshot wound inflicted on the one Rahul.

25,East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir and Gandhi Nagar MLA Anil Kumar Bajpai  though both from the BJP  are at loggerheads over the issue of finding a solution to traffic jams on the Gandhi Nagar main road. The area falls under the East Delhi constituency. While Bajpai wants that commercial vehicles should not be allowed in the area during peak hours — from 1 pm to 7 pm — Gambhir wants area to be declared one-way instead of stopping entry of any vehicle. The issue has also led to confrontation between the leaders  with Bajpai saying he had suggested that tempos  delivery vans and rickshaws carrying commercial items for delivery not be allowed on the 1-km road. With several shops for readymade garments and textiles on both sides of the road  where loading unloading of goods takes place through the day  Gandhi Nagar Market sees several traffic jams. “I met with residents  traders  police. Plans were finalised and had to be kicked off from November 5 on a 20-day trial basis… which our MP got stalled by making phone calls to senior police officers… Though Gambhir ji is from my party  concern for people comes first for me ” Bajpai told The Indian Express. Gambhir responded saying stopping commercial vehicles is not the solution and would cause problems to traders and shopkeepers  whose business has already been hit due to Covid: “Gandhi Nagar is Asia’s largest clothing market. I stand fully with the merchants. Due to Covid  the market was hit. I spoke to the DCP and they agreed to start one-way traffic after Diwali on a trial basis.” “If we succeed  we will continue it. But stopping commercial vehicles is not the solution and would cause many problems to merchants and shopkeepers ” said Gambhir. To this  Bajpai said it was residents and traders who had supported his plan as they feared one-way traffic will not solve the problems due to commercial vehicles parking haphazardly and unloading goods  causing traffic jams. Sunil Jain  general secretary of Gandhi nagar (Subhash Road) wholesale readymade market association  said: “If the area is declared one-way  some can use internal roads and this can lead to jams. And if commercial vehicles are stopped  it will pose problems for traders as they have to unload and load their supplies.Traders should also ensure if they are halting a vehicle  there should be no jam.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

27,In the two months since Delhi Metro resumed operations across all its lines  the number of passengers has seen a sharp jump — according to data shared by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC)  the average daily line utilisation went up from 6 19 242 in September to 12 24 848 in October. Line utilisation indicates how many times passengers have travelled on a particular line or portion of a line during their overall journey on the Metro system. Despite the increase in footfall  measures to keep Covid at bay remain firmly in place. A DMRC spokesperson said  “Even though the crowd is increasing gradually  measures such as sanitisation  thermal checks  and cashless transactions are in place. Operators ensure there are no more than 50 passengers getting on to one coach.” Previously  each train would carry 250-300 people. “People have been very conscious since the Metro restarted operations. They might have to wait in line for their train. This is why we have been asking them to keep half an hour in hand so they do not get late ” said the spokesperson. Rajiv Chowk  which continues to be one of the most crowded stations in the city  witnessed peak-hour rush on Saturday evening. Since only one gate is open to passengers  long queues were seen outside the station. Aman Ranjan (32)  who was traveling from Connaught Place to Tughlakabad  considered taking an auto or a cab when he saw the lines outside. “This happens every day. Sometimes  it takes half an hour for the line to clear. Today  it seems quicker ” he said. Some stepped out of the lines and opted for other modes of transport  while other passengers were heard complaining: “Yaha social distance kaise rakha jayega?’’ Another commuter said the wait was a better option as the line cleared in 12 minutes. Inside the station  passengers headed to the sanitisation points without being prompted. Similarly  those who waited on the platform stood in line and tried not to bump into each other. The DMRC spokesperson said  “Passengers are careful even inside trains as fines are imposed if anyone sits on seats that have the ‘do not sit here’ sticker. The trains are sanitised once they reach the terminal station.” Anandam Nair (54)  a government employee who travels from Mayur Vihar to Shadipur for work  said she feels safe traveling via the Metro as all precautions are taken: “I sanitised my hands and bags at the entrance. The Metro is definitely one of the safest ways to travel at the moment.” She said she travels by bus sometimes but still prefers the Metro: “Yet  at peak hour  social distancing is harder as everyone wants to get to work or home.” An operator in charge of crowds confirmed this  “We ask people to wait in line so that no coach exceeds its capacity. But sometimes  during peak hour  it becomes difficult to do so.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Virender Yadav added  “We appeal to people who have recovered from Covid to come forward and donate plasma  as it can help save lives of other infected persons.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

29,"Air quality of Delhi is not expected to make a significant improvement from the present severe levels unless there is a reduction in “unusually high emissions” from farm fires in northwest India  two central government air quality monitoring projects said on Saturday. For a third day in a row  the average air quality index (AQI) of Delhi and nearby NCR towns on Saturday remained severe  in which the concentration of toxic fine particles suspended in the air is at least four times above their acceptable limit. This affects healthy population and also “seriously impacts” people with medical conditions  as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The factor that is causing the concentration of these toxic particles — PM 2.5 and PM 10 — to increase is slow wind speed  particularly at night time  which is hindering dispersion of particulates accumulated in the air from regional and external sources of emissions. This includes stubble burning  which had an estimated 32% share in Delhi’s PM 2.5 levels on Saturday  as per the Central air quality monitoring project SAFAR. “Despite moderate day-time dispersion condition  air quality has declined owing to sustained  unusually high (farm) fire emissions. Surface winds have become calm today morning and pollutants are accumulating near the surface ” a bulletin from SAFAR stated on Saturday. It added  “No quick recovery is expected unless a drastic reduction in fire counts takes place. Air quality is forecast to stay in the severe to the higher end of very poor category for the next two days.” The SAFAR bulletin also stated that around 4 500 farm fires were observed on Friday in Punjab  Haryana  Uttar Pradesh  Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas  and the wind direction over Delhi-NCR is from the north-west  which helps in transporting pollutants from these states. The 24-hour average AQI of Delhi on Saturday deteriorated to 427 (severe) from 406 on Friday  as per the CPCB. Hourly concentration of PM 2.5 in Delhi-NCR on Saturday  as per CPCB data  was in the range of 250-300 µg/m3 — which is considered the emergency threshold — against its 24-hour exposure limit of 60 µg/m3. Concentration of PM 10 was in the range of 440-500 µg/m3  also the emergency threshold  against its exposure limit of 100 µg/m3.
Health effects of inhaling high levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10include aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular problems. A forecast for Diwali from the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi said the AQI is likely to be in the high end of the very poor category on November 13 and in the severe category on November 14 and 15. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

30,A weekly radio programme  called Kanoon Ki Chopal  was launched Saturday for Mandoli and Tihar Jail inmates to help them understand the law and legal procedures related to their cases. Prison officials said the inmates need legal counsel as some of them have not had a chance to meet their families and speak to their lawyers regularly due to the Covid pandemic. DG (Delhi Prisons) Sandeep Goel said they will work with the Delhi State Legislative Services Authority (DSLSA) to have lawyers or judicial officers on the radio show to answer questions for inmates. Inmates in jails will be given time before the show to submit their questions. Once these are compiled  prison authorities will take out common questions and will give them to the show host. The DSLSA released a statement  saying: “Inmates always have many questions about their cases  procedure and law. We want to address this issue so that these questions may be answered as far as possible. Radio is a dynamic  interactive and fascinating mechanism to communicate…” DG Goel said they also used the radio service to make announcements about Covid news  precautions and other updates. A jail official said they have already received multiple queries at Tihar’s jail no. 4. “This show is necessary. Many inmates are stressed over bail applications and the furlough process. They are not aware of legal terms and procedures. We have already received several questions about bail and the parole system. Some have also asked about their cases and the court’s orders. We have submitted these questions to the seniors ” said the official. On Diwali celebrations in prisons  DG Goel said: “This year  we can’t celebrate Diwali due to active Covid cases in the jails. We will serve special meals on the days of puja and the festival  but we can’t organise aarti and cultural activities.” For inmates who want to offer prayers  officials have allowed them to do so in their cells. Inmates listen to hymns and other songs in the morning for two-three hours through the prison radio system. “We do this on most days at Tihar and Mandoli jails. People submit the choice of their songs and we play the recorded versions next day. We are still trying to make the prisons Covid-free. We want inmates to stay inside their cells  but also keep them entertained and healthy ” said an official. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

31,With Delhi breaching the 7 000-mark in daily cases for the first time  the crunch in Covid ICU beds with ventilator support  so far seen at the city’s private hospitals  is now being felt even at government facilities. On Friday  the capital recorded 7 178 cases and 64 deaths  taking the count to 4 23 831 and the death toll to 6 833 — 42 187 cases were logged in the last week. And out of 1 250 ICU ventilator beds across private and government hospitals  912  or almost 73 per cent  are occupied. Data available on the Delhi government’s Corona app shows that not a single ICU bed with a ventilator is available at Safdarjung  Deen Dayal Upadhaya and Sardar Patel hospitals. These are among the 14 government hospitals with ICU beds earmarked for Covid patients in the city. At Ram Manohar Lohia hospital  of the 28 ICU ventilator beds  only two are lying vacant; at the AIIMS trauma centre  five beds are available out of 50; and at Lady Hardinge Medical College  nine beds are available of 17. All three come under the Centre. “In the last 48 hours  there has been a sudden spike in the number of patients getting admitted to hospitals. The situation is quite grim at the moment — even the severity of the disease has gone up in some cases. Currently  we are running at maximum capacity but have an expansion plan  which has been submitted to the Centre. If the need arises  we can add 25-30 more beds for Covid patients ” said Dr N N Mathur  medical director  LHMC. The situation is similar at Delhi government-run hospitals. At the biggest dedicated Covid facility  Lok Nayak  19 ICU ventilator beds are available out of 200. There are 128 ventilator beds in the ICU at GTB hospital  out of which 11 are vacant. “For the last one week  we have been getting 80-90 patients admitted on a daily basis  and approximately 50 per cent of them are shifted to the ICU. We had increased the number of ICU beds to 430 two weeks ago and  if required  will add more ” said Dr Suresh Kumar  medical director  Lok Nayak hospital. Observing a crunch in the ICU facilities  the Delhi government Friday augmented the number of Covid beds in eight state-run and 14 private hospitals in an order issued by the Health department. Overall  more than 1 100 beds have been added to the existing strength. Critical care facilities in 48 of 82 private hospitals are running full  as per the Delhi government’s app. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

32,Accusing the municipal corporations of financial mismanagement and “shameful politics” over salary delay in MCD schools  deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to the mayors of all three corprations claiming that the government has done its part by sending funds due to them. “The salaries to all MCD school teachers be paid immediately and in any case before Diwali to enable their families to have some meaningful festivities ” he wrote. Sisodia pointed out that the CAG report on the NCT of Delhi found that unpaid loans worth Rs 3 814.89 crore were due to the government by the three MCDs as on March 2018  and also wrote that they collectively owe Rs 2 596.32 crore to DJB as arrears. However  North Delhi mayor Jai Prakash said the Delhi government owes money to the corporation. “They owe Rs 13 500 crore to the corporations  out of which Rs 6 550 crore is for North Delhi municipal corporation… ” he said. “Whether our salaries are pending with the Delhi government or the corporation  our only concern is that they be released immediately ” said North MCD teachers’ association head Ramnivas Solanki. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

33,Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia Friday said that despite having surplus funds  audit reports of five Delhi government-funded Delhi University (DU) colleges showed financial irregularities and “illegal and unauthorised” spending of government funds. The colleges are Deen Dayal Upadhayaya College (DDU)  Keshav Mahavidyalaya  Shaheed Sukhdev College of Business Studies  Bhagini Nivedita College and Maharishi Valmiki College of Education. “We had ordered an audit of seven colleges  which initially refused to show books and accounts to auditors. Finally  on the court’s directions  five of these colleges started showing their accounts. Lakshmibai College and Aditi Mahavidyalaya have still not shown theirs  so one can sense something dubious may be going on ” Sisodia said. “Audit reports of these five colleges show the Delhi government has been paying more than enough money. Yet  funds have been misappropriated and staff salaries have been stopped  so that the Delhi government can be accused of not providing sufficient funds ” he added. Sisodia said “unauthorised payments have been made in an arbitrary fashion”. “To get salaries for teaching and non-teaching staff  posts were created on a whim. No government approval was taken for these posts… The Delhi government funds the college  so you cannot increase expenditure as per your own whim. You will have to ask the government whether they can pay for these posts ” he said. “The most shocking aspect is that when auditors asked for the attendance registers for these posts  there were no registers. Employees who are being paid salary  do they come to college or even exist? There are apprehensions that many are ghost employees for whom salaries are being claimed from the Delhi government ” he added. Sisodia said expenditure was also made on laptops  computers  equipment  hiring of vehicles  etc without consulting the government. “You will be surprised to know that for security guards  Rs 40 000 per person (per month) was shown as expenditure. Whereas we all know that security guards are paid between Rs 14 000-20 000 ” he said. A principal of one of the five colleges said  “The allegations are completely false. The money in our FDs is taken from students for their activities… This money has accumulated over 25 years. If this is financial bungling  every DU college will have this… This is all political as our governing bodies don’t have their chairman.” S K Garg  former principal of DDU College  whose term ended last year  said  “From 2007-8 onwards  we wrote at least 30-40 letters asking them for staff  but they don’t respond… but colleges cannot become non-functional. So  with the permission of GB  we appointed contractual staff based on infrastructural needs. They are just settling political scores with BJP and victimising colleges.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

34,Laying the foundation stone for the redevelopment of Rohtak Road Friday afternoon  Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “It was a long due request from the people in the area  and the ones travelling on it… Every road undergoes repair in five years  but this one was made nine years ago and overusage has led to damage.” The project will be undertaken at a cost of Rs 25 crore and is expected to be completed in six months. For years  residents and commuters have been complaining of deep potholes and broken footpaths that lead to accidents  and of choking pipes that cause waterlogging in the monsoon. PWD officials attributed this to problems in the drainage system and overuse of the road. The project will use ‘cold-milling’ technology where the upper layer of the road is reused in the redevelopment of the road. A PWD official said  “Of late  this technology is being used in a lot of projects. Earlier  we would keep adding layers on the existing road. But then the drainage pattern would get disrupted as water would accumulate in lower-lying residential areas instead of flowing out to the main road.” Further  it also reduces the cost of a project by 10-15 per cent. The strengthening of the road is expected to ease traffic and prevent water-logging in the area. After fixing the issues on the 13.33-km road  officials propose to take up work to fix the drainage system. Delhi Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain  who was present at the foundation stone laying ceremony  said that even though the stipulated time for the project is six months  efforts will be made to complete it within four months. He said  “There was an increasing demand to strengthen the road owing to potholes. The redevelopment work will ease the travel of the people commuting from Bahadurgarh to Delhi and Delhi to Mundka.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

35,Pollutants from farm fires in Punjab  Haryana and neighbouring regions were said to be playing a major role in deterioration of Delhi-NCR’s air quality  which continued to remain close to ‘severe’ level on Friday. Around 5 100 farm fire counts were recorded over Punjab on Thursday by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) Air Quality Early Warning System (EWS) for Delhi — the second day in a row when close to 5 000 fires have been recorded in the state. Explained| Panel for New Delhi’s air: role  powers  what’s new The MoES air quality monitor SAFAR stated that farm fires in Punjab  Haryana  Uttar Pradesh  Uttarakhand and neighbouring areas had an estimated 21% share in Delhi’s PM2.5 levels — fine particles suspended in the air — on Friday  lower than 42% recorded on Thursday. VK Soni  head of the Environment Monitoring and Research Center of the India Meteorological Department  said  “Large number of fires were recorded in Punjab and neighbouring areas on Thursday  which is impacting the air quality of not only Delhi-NCR but the entire Indo-Gangetic plain… If the farm fires were not there  then the air quality would not have reached this stage.” He added that from the years 2017 to 2019  approximately 55 000 fire counts were recorded in Punjab every year during the stubble burning season  and this year  around 50 000 counts have been recorded so far. In the year 2016  around 80 000 fire counts were recorded. Read| Haze chokes Delhi  pollution levels highest since November last year The EWS has forecast that winds over Delhi-NCR on Saturday would be from the northwest direction  which is favourable for transporting pollutants from stubble burning states. However  the AQI is expected to improve to the higher end of ‘very poor’ category on Saturday and Sunday. A bulletin from SAFAR said  “Better dispersion condition and not-so-calm winds is forecast for the next two days  which is likely to improve Delhi’s air quality index (AQI) unless more than estimated (farm) fire-related emission takes place.” Delhi’s 24-hour average AQI on Friday was 406  in the ‘severe’ category  which impacts healthy population and “seriously impacts” people with pre-existing medical conditions  as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The AQI on Thursday was 450. Air quality of nearby NCR towns also remained in the ‘severe’ category or close to it. Concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR on Friday remained above 410 and 230 µg/m3 against their 24-hour exposure limit of 100 and 60 µg/m3  as per CPCB data. A CPCB-led task force had Thursday recommended that government and private offices in Delhi-NCR reduce vehicle usage by 30% in view of ‘severe’ air quality. Meanwhile  Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday saidthat around 2 300 complaints against polluting activities have been received on the ‘Green Delhi’ mobile application since its launch on October 29 — mostly about waste burning. Out of these  over 1 300 or 58% of complaints have been solved. “Most of the complaints are from the North MCD area… From Monday  14 teams of the Delhi government that are monitoring ground situation will directly visit areas to solve the complaints ” he said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

36,The Ministry of Home Affairs and Delhi government have granted sanction to prosecute Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in connection with their alleged involvement in the February communal riots in Northeast Delhi  Delhi Police said Friday. A spokesperson of the Delhi government termed the development “purely procedural”. “The Law department has given its legal opinion after due diligence to the Home department of Delhi government. The elected government has no role to play in this. Delhi government has not stopped prosecution in any case in the last five years  including those pertaining to AAP MLAs and party leaders ” the AAP government said. Khalid  a former JNU student  and Imam were arrested by the police in cases under sections of UAPA on September 14 and August 25 respectively. “We have received prosecution sanctions in several Delhi riots cases. Earlier  we received them against the 15 accused who were named in the Crime Branch chargesheet. Two weeks ago  the Delhi government and MHA sent sanctions against other accused  including Khalid and Imam ” said a senior police officer. The chargesheet was filed against 15 persons under UAPA in a case of alleged conspiracy related to the riots. The chargesheet included names of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain  Pinjra Tod’s Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal  former DU student Gulfisha  and Jamia students Meeran Haider  Asif Tanha and Safoora Zargar. Police have also charged them under IPC sections 153A and 124A. The state government needs to grant sanctions to the police to prosecute any accused under Section 196 of the CrPC (offences against the State and for criminal conspiracy to commit such offence). A police officer said names of Khalid and Imam can be added in the supplementary chargesheet. An MHA official also confirmed prosecution sanction against Khalid and other riots accused under UAPA section 13. “A month ago  we applied for the sanctions against Faizan Khan  Khalid and Imam  all booked under UAPA. The MHA and Delhi Govt approved these two weeks ago ” a senior police officer said. Khan  accused of providing a SIM card on a fake ID to Asif Tanha and activating it  was granted bail by the court on October 24. Explaining the sanctions  a police officer said  “The accused were booked under sections 13  16  17 and 18 of UAPA. To prosecute someone under section 13  the court demands sanctions from the Centre. In the case of other sections  the state government is the competent authority.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

40,Police on Friday arrested two persons in connection with the murder of a Greater Noida-based businessman and his wife inside their home. The accused  Aman Khan (19)  worked at a store owned by the victim Vinay Gupta (60)  adjacent to his apartment in Cherry County. According to police Vinay and his wife Neha (55) were murdered after the couple resisted a robbery bid. “Once we began investigating the case  we found the movements of Aman suspicious. We scanned CCTV footage and found he was in the vicinity after 11.45 pm  the same time Vinay’s son had left the house. On further investigation it was found that Aman was in need of money because of his relationship with a minor. The minor’s father has also been arrested since he demanded money ” said Harish Chander  DCP Gautam Buddh Nagar. According to police  Vinay had a family-run department store which sold groceries  jewellery and other items. Aman worked at the store and was aware that Vinay would deposit the day’s earnings in the bank the next day. The accused allegedly had an affair with a 16-year-old girl from Noida  police said. The girl’s father was aware of their acquaintance and would blackmail Aman for money. Aman  in dire need for money  planned to rob the couple as he knew they would have cash with them  said police. “Since it was Karwa Chauth  there was a henna stall outside their shop. He stayed till everyone left and around 12 am  went to the couple’s house  demanding money. The couple told him they do not have the money. An argument took place and Aman attacked the woman with a showpiece and then her husband. We have recovered from him Rs 70 000 that he stole after the murder ” said Harish Chander  DCP Gautam Buddh Nagar. Police had earlier questioned more than 20 employees at Vinay’s store and it was found that Aman had been absconding.

41,The Delhi Police on Friday registered a case against YouTuber Gaurav Wasan for allegedly misappropriating funds received as donation for the owner of ‘Baba Ka Dhaba’  an eatery in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. Kanta Prasad (80)  the owner of the eatery  had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully recounting the desperation of the months since the lockdown was shot by Wasan and shared widely across social media platforms recently. The case was registered against the YouTuber following a complaint lodged by Prasad on October 31  nearly a month after the video went viral. In his complaint to police  Prasad alleged that Wasan “intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation… without providing any information to the complainant”. Wasan  however  denied the allegations. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said  “After we received a complaint  preliminary enquiry was done and an FIR was registered under section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of Indian Penal Code and an investigation has been initiated.” Earlier in the day  Prasad said he was hurt over being called “greedy” by some people on the social media after he lodged a complaint against Wasan and challenged the YouTuber to disclose his bank details to prove his innocence. Talking to reporters at a press conference  Prasad  accompanied by his lawyer Prem Joshi and blogger Tushant  claimed that Wasan gave him a cheque of 2.33 lakh on October 26 after the YouTuber was trolled for not handing over the donation amount to Prasad. Tushant alleged that Wasan has only disclosed his bank account statements from October 7 to 10 whereas he received more money after that. He demanded that Wasan must reveal his bank account statements till October 26. Joshi highlighted that in the initial videos shared by Wasan  he had claimed that Prasad did not have a bank account or a mobile phone but that was a “lie”. Joshi also claimed that on October 26  when Wasan gave the cheque to Prasad  he made him sign a paper claiming that all dues had been settled. However  later he again gave Rs 1.45 lakh to Prasad.  Wasan  however  said that he has submitted to the police his bank account statements till November 2 and maintained that he gave all the amount received as donation for Prasad to him.  📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

42,The Supreme Court Friday asked the Centre to ensure there is no smog in Delhi-NCR as it was informed that the commission for air quality management will start functioning from today. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian posted the pleas related to air pollution for hearing after the Diwali vacation. The Centre on Thursday appointed former Chief Secretary of Delhi M M Kutty chairperson of the Commission for Air Quality Management (AQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta  appearing for the Centre  informed the bench that the Commission will start functioning from Friday and the government has appointed the members. While referring to the recent ordinance on Air Pollution  Mehta said that he would place it on record. The bench told the Solicitor General that he may place it on record but the court will hear the matter after Diwali vacation. “The only thing is that you ensure that there is no smog in the city. We are not concerned with commission. There are many commissions and many brains are working but just ensure that there is no smog in the city”  the bench said. Mehta replied that government is taking all efforts on war footing. Senior advocate Vikas Singh  appearing for petitioner Aditya Dubey  said the chairman of the commission is a bureaucrat and it could have been a retired judge of the HC. “There is no member from the Union health ministry”  he said. The bench said the commission can talk to anybody in the country. Singh contended that there is no classification of offence and Rs 1 crore fine and five year jail is a little bit arbitrary. The bench pointed out that all offences in the ordinance are non-cognizable  to which Singh replied that these are cognizable. It told Mehta that there is no grading of offence to which he said that government will like to respond to it. “We don’t want to advise. These are all knowledgeable people and there are NGO people also”  the bench said. Mehta pointed that there are experts from the field besides members from NGOs in the newly created commission and they will all start working from Friday. Singh added that the situation today is almost of a public health emergency and something drastic needs to be done. The bench said  “We are a court of law. This is a problem which has to be dealt with by the executive. They have the money  the power and the resources for this. We are not abdicating our responsibility or functions but understand this  we have some limitations.” Singh said that by the time court will reopen after vacation  it (pollution) may all be over. The bench said that it will keep the matter on reopening after the Diwali vacation. On October 29  the top court was informed by the Centre that it has come out with an Ordinance on curbing pollution and it has been promulgated already. The top court had said that it would have to look at the Ordinance before passing any direction in the matter which has raised issues regarding pollution caused due to stubble burning in neighbouring states of Delhi. The apex court had on October 26 kept in abeyance its earlier order appointing one-man panel of retired apex court judge Justice Madan B Lokur to monitor the steps taken by neighbouring states to prevent stubble burning which is a major cause of pollution in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR). “Some experts have informed us informally that it is not only stubble burning that creates pollution”  the CJI had said. “We would like you to stop using your beautiful cars. Which you won’t. We should all go about on bikes — not motorbikes but bicycles”  the CJI had observed. Earlier  the apex court had kept in abeyance its October 16 order appointing one-man panel of Justice (retd) Lokur while considering the Centre’s stand that it is coming out with a comprehensive legislation to deal with air pollution  including the aspect of stubble burning. Mehta had told the bench that the Centre has taken a “holistic view” of the matter and the draft of the proposed law on curbing pollution would be submitted in the apex court within four days. In its October 16 order  the top court had directed deployment of National Cadet Corps  National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and Guides for assisting in the monitoring of stubble burning in the agricultural fields of Punjab  Haryana  Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR  saying all it wants is that “people of Delhi-NCR can breathe fresh air without any pollution”. It had raised concern over the worsening air quality in Delhi-NCR and appointed one-man panel of Justice (retd) Lokur to monitor the steps taken by the neighbouring states to prevent stubble burning  while brushing aside objections of the Centre  Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. During his tenure as an apex court judge  Justice Lokur who headed social-justice bench had dealt with pollution matters which included the aspect of stubble burning. The top court is also hearing a separate plea filed in 1985 by environmentalist M C Mehta on air pollution and had last year even taken a suo motu note of alarming rise in air pollution in Delhi-NCR where several directions have been passed with regard to stubble burning. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

44,Eleven days after a 20-year-old woman was shot dead outside her college in Faridabad  allegedly by her former classmate  police on Friday filed the chargesheet in the case in a district court. “The chargesheet has been prepared in record time as a result of the hard work put in by the Special Investigation Team day and night. It is 700 pages long and includes 60 witnesses ” said Sube Singh  PRO of Faridabad Police. “It was prepared on the basis of digital  forensic and material evidence which  along with witness accounts  will help to ensure that the accused are given stringent punishment soon ” he said. It has been filed under IPC Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy)  302 (murder)  366 (kidnapping  abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage)  and 364 (kidnapping  or abducting in order to murder) as well as the Arms Act. The incident took place on the afternoon of October 26 when Nikita Tomar emerged out of Aggarwal College  where she was a third-year B.Com student. Two men tried to first drag her into their vehicle at gunpoint  and one of them shot her when she resisted. She had succumbed to her injuries while undergoing treatment the same day. In the 24 hours that followed  Faridabad Police had arrested both the men involved in the incident  identified as Tauseef  who had been in school with Tomar  and Rehaan  who was Tauseef’s friend. Investigations had revealed that Tauseef harboured one-sided feelings for Tomar  and had been pressuring her to marry him. Officials said he had abducted her in 2018 as well but she had been rescued by police within hours. Tomar’s relatives said they had lodged an FIR regarding the matter but had dropped the case after Tauseef’s relatives begged them to do so. Police also arrested a third accused  Ajru  in the case  who they said had provided the two assailants with the weapon used in the crime. “In the days since the incident  arms licenses have been granted to the brother of the victim and her uncle for self defense  and a gunman has been deployed for each member of the family. The father of the eyewitness in the case has also been given an arms license. This will help them all to fight the case without any fear ” said the PRO. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

47,In celebration of ‘Maharashtra’s most beloved personality’  Purushottam Laxman Deshpande  also known as Pu La Deshpande  Google dedicated Sunday’s doodle to the multi-talented Indian for his 101st birth anniversary.  Illustrated by the Mumbai-based guest artist Sameer Kulavoor  the doodle for November 8  gives us a glimpse into the achievements of the legendary Indian writer  film and stage actor  composer  musician  singer and orator  philanthropist and humorist. He was widely regarded as a popular culture icon of his time for his sharp observations of life  and his signature style of joyful humour and satire.  Purushottam Laxman Deshpande was born in Mumbai on November 8  1919  into a family that already had an illustrious literary legacy. His grandfather was the translator of Rabindranath Tagore’s Gitanjali into Marathi. Before Pu La Deshpande began a career in music  he earned a master’s degree and served as a college lecturer. His writing premier was through Bombay magazine and soon he went on to write many novels  essays  comedy books  travelogues  children’s plays  and one-man stage shows  most of which attained mass popularity in Maharashtra. The illustrator of the doodle  Sameer Kulavoor talks about the influence of Pu La Deshpande on the literary culture of Maharashtra saying  “Being born and brought up in Mumbai/Maharashtra  one comes across Pu La Deshpande’s name and works constantly in popular culture - music  writing  films  theatre  literature  and more.”  He also mentioned that in the doodle  he alludes to a Deshpande song that he remembers from his schooling days and wanted to pay tribute to Deshpande’s colourful personality. “PuLa’s life and work is the message! I hope to highlight the fact that one can have several different outlets and forms to creativity.” Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter ,mumbai,ht
48,Till March of this year  when the Covid panic set in  I was on a plane at least once a week. This state of affairs had persisted since 1986. But ever since I came back from Mumbai where I had gone for the Culinary Culture launch in early March  I have not stepped onto a plane. Frankly  I don’t miss it one bit. I hate airports anyway and the Coronavirus gives me a good reason to avoid them.  If all goes well  I am hoping not to get on a plane for the rest of this year. But every now and then  one feels the urge to get away from home  to take a break. A couple of months ago  my wife and I decided we would find a hotel that was as sanitization crazy as we were and take a few days off. We would have to go somewhere nearby because we were only willing to drive. The ITC Grand Bharat was the obvious choice because I know how obsessed the chain’s boss Nakul Anand is with keeping his hotels sanitised and Covid-free  with a new service style that minimises needless human contact while still delivering luxury.  The Grand Bharat is in Manesar  just beyond Gurgaon  and we managed the drive from our South Extension flat in an hour. We ordered a hotel car and it came with full sanitization measures  including a partition between the driver and passengers. We wore masks anyway though the driver had a mask  shield etc. The Grand Bharat is an all-suite  low-rise property spread out over several acres with its own world-class golf course (nice but of no use to a non-golfer like me) and offered incredible room service. So we never went to a single restaurant but ate extremely well. It is no surprise to get good North Indian food at any ITC hotel but Grand Bharat did excellent South Indian and Western food as well. The staff wore masks  maintained social distancing and stayed as far away as possible. Housekeeping cleaned the room when we went walking in the extensive grounds and room service laid out the food while we were in another room. Rarely have I felt safer since the start of the pandemic. Though most hotels face a slump during this terrible phase  Grand Bharat is the happy exception. When I went  they were doing 65 per cent occupancy on weekdays and over 80 per cent on weekends. On recent weekends  because of great word of mouth  occupancy is 100% and it is the destination of choice for Delhi people. By the first week of October we grew bolder. We drove for three and a half hours (sanitized car from the hotel) before we got to what must be the most influential resort hotel in India; Rajvilas. I first went shortly after Biki Oberoi opened it in 1997 as a super-luxury resort on the outskirts of Jaipur  fell in love with it and argued passionately with other hoteliers who said that to sustain the resort  Biki would have to charge room rates that nobody had ever charged in India.   In fact  Rajvilas got higher rates than anyone had imagined and the resorts that followed (Udaivilas  Vanyavilas  Wildflower Hall  Sukhvilas  etc.) transformed Indian hoteliering and continue to feature on lists of the world’s best hotels. Today  nobody can open a luxury resort in India without incorporating at least some Rajvilas elements— so great has the hotel’s influence been. If you go to Rajvilas now  as we did  there is nothing to indicate that it was built two decades ago. It is regularly refurbished and the Oberoi obsession with improving the guest experience ensures that no two visits are alike. There are some lovely garden rooms  some with pools and even the entry level rooms (which is all I could afford when the hotel opened) are pretty spectacular. On this visit  we had a garden where dozens of peacocks visited all day  prancing and dancing so beautifully that I just kept staring at them. Rajvilas may have the best food of any Oberoi resort because Jaydeep Patil  the chef  is creative and a master of many cuisines. His food  the ambience and the Oberoi flair can make anything special. Our visit was timed for my wife’s birthday  so the hotel first took us to the temple for an aarti. (There is a 300-year-old temple on the hotel grounds. The Oberoi restored it and it serves as a functioning Shiva temple.) Then we sat under the stars by the pool while hundreds of diyas gleamed in the night. It is hard to think of a more magical experience.     Last week  we got really ambitious and drove four and a half hours to a village called Ajabgarh near the Rajasthan town of Alwar to spend a few days  at Amanbagh. If you haven’t heard of Amanbagh  don’t worry. Nobody I spoke to had heard of it either. And even well-travelled people in Delhi knew very little about Aman hotels  which I found odd. Aman is one of the pioneers of a certain kind of luxury hoteliering. In 1988  Amanpuri opened in Phuket and as the global economy boomed  Aman became the resort chain of choice for the world’s millionaires. Every investment banker dreamt of vacationing at an Aman resort and new hotels opened all over the world from Bali (where I have stayed in two different properties) to Venice (where George Clooney got married) to Wyoming. No two Amans were alike but the basic promise was that the hotels would be small  exclusive and  to give the millionaires a break from their lives of excess  starkly elegant in their design.  The company opened its first city hotel in Delhi (a complete disaster; it has now been salvaged and renamed The Lodi)  which showed that it was not so good at city hotels (though I gather that the newer Tokyo hotel is fine) and eventually the  Aman chain was taken over by billionaire Vladislav Doronin who now runs it. Amanbagh has been around for 15 years  a lovely  tranquil resort with 160 staff for just 37 suites (16 of them pool villas) without attracting any domestic attention. I thought the villas were lovely with a stunning  design by the celebrated architect Ed Tuttle and while the hotel offers  a different ambience from Rajvilas (most regular guests used to be foreigners but now  during the pandemic  you may find screaming children being pursued by harried ayahs in the public areas)  it lives up to Aman’s reputation for restrained elegance and luxury. It is very well run  the service is warm and efficient  and food is  good. Amanbagh is 20 minutes from the Sariska park  the surroundings are beautiful  it grows its own vegetables and there is no hotel quite like it anywhere in India. So: three very nice holidays in these difficult times. And we have learned that driving is the new flying!

49,The pandemic has made philosophers of us all. Or at least dubious life coaches. As we nervously attempt to break out of months of isolation  it’s fascinating how often we use the term ‘solitude’ and our relationship with it. Even those who usually shy away from chats that don’t involve football  fashion or fitness are now seeking deep conversations about the meaning of life. Thoughts of solitude are crowding our collective thinking  it appears. Kebab penance I find an autorickshaw to be the perfect place to be alone with my thoughts. Open on all sides  swift and easily steered  it offers superb metaphors for unencumbered thinking. But these days  with driver and passenger both masked  a plastic sheet fluttering between them for largely psychological purposes  the mind isn’t really at ease. As I contemplate the stage of evolution of my pandemic personality  I find I’ve missed the turn I needed to take  impossible to identify in the middle of all the hectic metro construction activity around Mumbai’s groaning suburbs. I flail my arms about to communicate the mistake to the driver  while he in turn mutters something unflattering under his mask. The same goes for a morning walk by the sea – a great opportunity for solitary reflection in the days of yore i.e.  2019. Now it’s all about stealthily clocking the mask-wearing habits of fellow walkers. I find I’m incapable of making eye contact with strollers anymore for fear of telepathically transmitting my unkind thoughts about the protective gear dangling ornamentally from their ears  hanging limply below their noses or wound playfully around their fingers. (On a not unrelated note  I find I enjoy my morning walks a lot more if I call them my kebab penance.)  One hundred styles of solitude Solitude is sly; it invites you home and then leaves its evil twin loneliness to greet you when you arrive. So many beautiful treks and restful retreats have been ruined by the impostor loneliness. The good news is that solitude is sometimes found in the least solitary places. Years ago  a feisty friend once told me how she finds a butcher’s shop to have a Zen effect on her. I wish I had a mask on to conceal my mortification. But the meat of her argument  so to speak  was that solitude doesn’t always wear green and chant beatifically. It can greet you as you’re going about your daily routine  loading a washing machine or looking up online recipes. Counter-intuitive as it seems  I have no beef with this kind of thinking. Another great thing about the sweet thing called solitude – it is shape-shifting  like Aladdin’s genie. So  if you once found it in the pages of Rumi but now seek it in the black-and-white posts of an Insta friend  it’s okay. It’s enough to be coping without having to worry about how woke or lit or baller our coping mechanisms are. And here I shall take a moment to appreciate my use of three millennial words in one xennial sentence  unsubtle as the attempt might be. Familiar strangers One thing that I’ve discovered about solitude this year is how everyone thinks it’s the right thing to want. But those who have had to go into strict hospital/home quarantine have a quite different take on the matter. The doorbell becomes the sweetest sound to deprived ears just out of confinement. As for me  the return of my cook and house help  and their many demands on my long-preserved solitude  are the high points of this year.  ’Tis the season to overthink human interaction. Now that the outdoors are unlocked  our minds are finding new ways to throw us back in prison. Is an open-air café safe? Should one get back to the gym? Is a walk on the beach harmless? I’m spending an unhealthy amount of time planning a grand return to my favourite pub  where the old faithful must no doubt be listening to Billy Joel sing “and they’re sharing a drink they call loneliness/but it’s better than drinking alone.” The solitude I crave is found in the vicinity of familiar strangers. And I’m not the only one… Follow @rehana_munir on Twitter and Instagram From HT Brunch  November 8  2020 Follow us on twitter.com/HTBrunch Connect with us on facebook.com/hindustantimesbrunch ,mumbai,ht

51, Maharashtra on Saturday recorded 3 959 Covid-19 infections  pushing the case count to 1 714 273. For the first time since July 11  the tally of active cases in the state fell under 100 000. The number of active cases stood at 99 151. The trend of fewer daily cases over the past few weeks has led to a constant decline in active infections. In the past 51 days  the state experienced a drop of more than 200 000 active cases. On September 17  its active cases tally was 3 01 752  the highest till date. However  there has been a decline since then and on September 30  the tally fell to 259 033 and on October 31  it further came down to 123 585  revealed official figures.  Fewer active cases indicate that the epidemic is in control.  Public health expert Sanjay Pattiwar said that cases have been reducing  but the state will have to be cautious and ensure that cases will not increase by November-end. “Decline in cases is a fact  but we have to wait till November-end as festivals are going on and winter has arrived. Plus  most lockdown restrictions have been lifted. We have to increase testing and contact tracing and if cases don’t rise till November-end then we can say that the state has successfully controlled the pandemic ” Pattiwar said. Although the Covid-19 curve in the state has been on the descending limb  chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a meeting on Saturday asked local authorities to be prepared for a second wave. He said that the next 15 days post Diwali would be crucial as there is a concern over a rise in cases owing to winter and ongoing festivals. He also directed testing potential super-spreaders  who have a lot of interaction with various groups of people  such as milkmen  maids  vegetable vendors and people working in public transport.  “We can see that the infection rate and death rate are coming down  however  we cannot remain inattentive. We have to be prepared for a second wave like it is going on in European countries ” the chief minister said in a review meeting of divisional commissioners and district collectors to look at measures to be taken to prevent a potential second wave. “I have said this in March that it is a world war and we have been fighting it and are close to win it without “arms”. We are relaxing restrictions in a graded manner. We have taken all precautions to prevent spread of seasonal diseases during summer and monsoon  but winter has arrived  which is likely to bring other respiratory diseases such as pneumonia  asthma  flu and heart diseases  apart from rise in Covid-19 ” Thackeray said.  The chief minister also asked local authorities not to discontinue or dismantle temporary Covid treatment facilities such as field hospitals as of now. He said  “Do not remove field hospitals or Covid Care Centers developed for Covid-19 treatment. In fact  remove any lacunae  if any  as we have got some time. We also need to keep a track of people with comorbidities. This will help in avoiding big trouble even if a second wave hits the state.” Mumbai reported its lowest daily Covid-19 surge in almost six months on Saturday when 576 new cases were reported  followed by 23 deaths. Before this  the lowest surge was 426 cases on May 12 and 587 cases on August 25. The daily positivity rate  too  on Saturday was under 6%. Since almost ten days  the daily positivity rate is below 10%.  As of Saturday  Mumbai had 263 049 Covid-19 cases  with 10 422 deaths. The city’s mortality rate is 3.96% and the recovery rate is 89.48% as 2 35 3850 patients have recovered till now. Mumbai has 16 528 active cases.  Meanwhile  the state toll breached the 45 000 mark as 150 casualties were reported  taking it to 45 115. Of them  70 were reported in the past 48 hours  47 from last week and the rest 33 were from the period before that  health officials said. Along with a trend of fewer Covid-19 cases  the state has recorded a drop in Covid-19 deaths. But its case fatality rate (CFR) is not coming down. It has maintained second position after Punjab in the country with 2.63%. The CFR of Punjab was 3.15% (with 4 295 deaths) till Friday  according to information shared by the state medical education department. In another meeting with senior officials of BMC  the chief minister directed them to take strict action against those not wearing masks. “We need to be more careful now. Take strict against those found not wearing mask. The initiative started against these offenders should be implemented aggressively. Apart from this  there should be a focus on creating public awareness to make people understand why masks are necessary ” he said. Convince people that if the pollution level doesn’t come down  the danger of coronavirus will be persist  he added. The state government has already urged people not to use firecrackers this Diwali to ensure pollution level will not rise as it may lead to respiratory issues. (With inputs from Mehul Thakkar)  ,mumbai,ht
52, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has appealed to residents to avoid firecrackers in view of the possible second wave of Covid.  Mohol said  “The central government team that visited Pune has stated of a possible second surge of Covid cases in December and January. As bursting of firecrackers cause respiratory-related problem  it also generate aerosols which may transmit Covid virus more rapidly. Some states have already taken a decision to ban firecrackers during Diwali. Hence  citizens on their own need to take necessary care and avoid firecrackers this seson.”  The mayor said that as the Mumbai municipal corporation has taken some decisions regarding firecrackers  the Pune counterpart has sought the details and could issue guidelines likewise.  “I request traders and kids who burst crackers during the festival  mainly on Laxmi Puja  to keep it at a minimum level as it will badly affect those with respiratory issues ” he said.  A civic official on condition of anonymity said  “With many restrictions already in place due to the Covid situation  we have only made a public appeal to avoid use of crackers instead of banning it. As it is  there is no mechanism to check citizens using firecrackers during the festival.”  Meanwhile  the civic administration has already put in place many checks and guidelines for crackers sellers to put up roadside stalls in an effort to bring down supply numbers.  NCP demands ban on cracker sale  Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) spokesperson Ankush Kakade has demanded the state ban on sale of firecrackers in view of the Covid situation. Kakade has written to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to take the decision as carried out by Delhi and other states.  ,mumbai,ht
53,Republic Television editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami  who was arrested along with two others in a 2018 case of abetment of suicide  has accused the Mumbai Police of torture in his bail plea. The petition has been filed by Goswami’s lawyer Harish Salve after the former’s arrest on Wednesday. It is being heard by a bench of justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik at the Bombay High Court. According to Bar and Bench  a website that covers legal news  Arnab Goswami claimed in his petition that during the course of arrest a senior police officer hit him with a heavy boot  he received a half a foot deep gash in his left hand and suffered serious injury to his spinal cord. Goswami also alleged that he was “forced to drink a liquid” by police officers while they surrounded him. He also said that after drinking the liquid he “choked”. The high court was on Saturday hearing the petition filed by Goswami seeking interim bail and challenging his arrest in the 2018 abetment of suicide case of interior designer Anvay Naik. The police said that they found a suicide note where Naik said that Goswami had not cleared his dues.

54,The minimum temperature on Saturday dropped below the 20 degrees Celsius mark in Mumbai  the lowest so far this season. The Santacruz weather observatory  representative of the suburbs and Mumbai  recorded the minimum temperature at 19.7 degrees Celsius  which was 2 degrees Celsius below normal.  However  there was a wide gap between the minimum temperature in the suburbs and in south Mumbai. The Colaba weather station  representative of south Mumbai  recorded 24 degrees Celsius  which was at the normal mark.  The weather bureau said minimum temperature was expected to hover in the range of 19-21 degrees Celsius over the next week due to the current wind pattern.  “For the first time this season  Mumbai has recorded the minimum temperature below 20 degrees Celsius. The cool winds from easterly and northeasterly direction is leading to this  which is also reducing moisture in the city’s air --- typical of the weather pattern during this time of the year ” said KS Hosalikar  deputy director general western region  India Meteorological Department.  The maximum temperature has remained at the normal mark in the suburbs and a degree Celsius below normal in south Mumbai.  Owing to a rise in wind speed over the past 48 hours  the air quality index (AQI) has remained in the moderate category  as per the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR). The AQI  which was at 221 (in poor category) earlier in the week  stood at 149 (moderate) on Saturday. Pollution levels are likely to decline further as an AQI of 132 (moderate) has been predicted for Sunday.  SAFAR categorises AQI levels for PM2.5 in the 0-50 range as good; 51-100 as satisfactory; 101-200 as moderate; 201-300 as poor; 301-400 as very poor and above 400 as severe. Location-wise minimum temperatures  as recorded by IMD’s automatic weather stations  showed Kandivali was the coolest at 18.9 degrees Celsius  followed by Malad at 19.6  while Panvel was the coolest in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region at 14.8 degrees Celsius.

59,The Covid-19 lockdown had everyone house-bound  that means parked cars were left for a long period of time in the company of rodents causing massive damage to cables of vehicles. Automobile service stations across city are coming across dozens of cases where rodents - rats  mice - have chewed wires and caused damaged worth lakhs of rupees to the owners. Neeraj Bhide  a resident of Prabhat road  had to spend Rs 1 40 000 to replace wiring and radiator fan of his luxury four-wheeler. “My car was parked at Prabhat road for the three months. In May  when the restrictions were eased while driving  I came to know that the engine temperature of my vehicle is very high as the radiator fan was not working ” said Bhide  a working professional. It was the first time Bhide has come across to such damage to his cars. “If your car is standing for a long period then such damage happens ” explained Bhide. Ashwin Apte  who runs Apte Shri Auto Service  near MIT College Kothrud  said  “Such problem arises only when the car is standing at one place for many days. Generally  rats are found in parking areas and after lockdown  many of our clients are facing similar problems.” The rats have either eaten wires in the engine compartment or have chewed cable of air condition and seat covers were also damaged. “Out of seven cars which we get to repair in a day  four-five cars have a problem of wire damages. Price of every wire varies  but on an average minimum one has to spend Rs10 000 to fix the wire connection ” added Apte. Another resident of Mumbai  who came to Pune  also faced the same problem  though he was lucky enough to drive safely to the city before he came to know that the wires of the car were damaged. Since March 2020 when the first lockdown was announced  his car was stationed at his car-park at Mumbai’s Malad West  located along the suburban railway track. “After coming to Pune  the mechanic detected that there was a short circuit of wiring inside the bonnet which happened due to chewing of wires. The manufacture had stopped the production of this particular model and so I preferred to book a new car for delivery during the upcoming Diwali rather than getting it repaired for a high estimate that the auto-mechanic had offered ” said the resident requesting anonymity. Another auto mechanic from Pimpri-Chinchwad said  though rats are smaller creatures  the damage they cause is immense  particularly when the vehicle is parked unattended for a longer period. “Such cases have increased during the lockdown as vehicles were parked for a longer period. In the past too we have attended similar problems ” said  Mahendra Patil  an auto-mechanic. Rishab Pokarna  a resident of Chakan  who faced a similar problem is still clueless about how much he will have to spend to repair his vehicle. “I was not in Pune during till last month so from around May  my car was parked in the society parking. On Sunday (November 1) when I tried to restart my car  it did not start and I had to tow my car and now how many wires have been damages is still not known ” he said. ,mumbai,ht

63,"MUMBAI: Hardening his government's position vis-a-vis the ownership of land in Kanjurmarg in Mumbai where the metro 3 car shed project will be coming up  Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said the Centre was trying to stall development projects in the city. In a webcast  Thackeray said a defamation campaign was ran by Maharashtra-haters"" who tried to project the state as a hub for the drugs and narcotics farming. He slammed the BJP for opposing the shifting of the metro car shed project to Kanjurmarg from the green lung Aarey Colony.

The state government and the BJP have been at loggerheads since Thackeray announced shifting of the metro car shed project last month. Thackeray said a string of attempts were made to create hurdles in the development of the state  but they all came unstuck. ""Maharashtra-haters ran a defamation campaign against the state to malign its image. They tried to paint Maharashtra as a lawless state where farming of drugs and narcotic substances happens. ""But  the fact is that we received investments worth crores of rupees for whichMoUs were signed  and now work would also start soon "" said the chief minister who heads the tripartite government of the Shiv Sena  NCP and Congress.

65,B G Kolse-Patil  retired judge of the Bombay High Court  on Sunday expressed surprise over the closure of the Anvay Naik suicide case by the then Devendra Fadnavis government despite “strong evidence” being available. “Abetment to suicide is like any other cognizable offence under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. Whoever abets the commission of a suicide is punishable with jail term of 10 years. This shows it’s a serious crime like murder or other cognizable offences ” he said. Revealing that he had himself written to Uddhav Thackeray days after he took charge as Chief Minister  Kolse-Patil said  “But I don’t claim the case was opened because of me…” In an abetment to suicide case  Kolse-Patil said a suicide note is the first key evidence. “However  to arrest the accused  supporting evidence is required. And in this case  supporting evidence regarding the studio work completed by Anvay Naik  some payment being made and Rs 82 lakh remaining outstanding were available ” he added. This means  said Kolse-Patil  there was “clinching” evidence available in the abetment to suicide case. “And yet  a A-summary report was filed. This was quite surprising. I don’t know why the Fadnavis government took such a step…” A-summary report is filed when allegations made in a complaint are found true  but there can be no prosecution for lack of evidence. “Yes  A-summary report means complaint is true. When the complaint is found to be true and when requisite supporting evidence is available  there is no reason why the case should be closed ” he said. Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami and two others were last week arrested under sections 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother over alleged non-payment of dues by Republic TV in 2018. Naik left a suicide note  blaming Goswami and two others. Adnya  Naik’s daughter  said  “I won’t be able to comment because the matter is sub-judice. But as we have already said in our press conference  we had submitted all supporting documentary evidence regarding the work done and outstanding payment of Rs 82 lakh. This is now in public domain.” On the other hand  state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said  “It seems because of political protection  Goswami and two others were not prosecuted… A senior minister in the Fadnavis government gave them political protection.” In May  Deshmukh had announced that he has ordered a fresh probe in the case after receiving a complaint from Adnya. Meanwhile  Kolse-Patil said he was also taken aback to find that police were denied custody of Goswami. “In this case  police had sought custody to take the investigation forward and recover more documentary evidence as alleged by the Naiks. The court rejected police custody. The court seems to have used its discretionary powers. But discretionary powers should be used for the sake of justice.” While denying police custody  the Chief Judicial Magistrate observed that there was no connection in the suicide chain in the case which was earlier closed in 2019 and Goswami’s role. The CJM said the case had been reopened without the court’s consent and that there was no “justifiable ground” for police custody. Regarding Goswami’s allegation Sunday that he was not allowed to meet a lawyer  Kolse-Patil said  “The accused should be allowed to meet the lawyer….” Senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said  “I met the jailer at Taloja jail at 1 pm today (Sunday) afternoon. I insisted on proper care  treatment and protection for Goswami. The jailer assured me of no harassment and proper medical treatment.” Somaiya said he also spoke to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. “I requested him to see that Goswami is not harassed. He assured me he would talk to concerned officials. I also spoke to Maharashtra Home Secretary in this connection.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

66,AN online awareness project by Amravati Rural police on legal protection against sexual offences against children has been taken up by the Maharashtra police for implementation across the state. Conceived by Superintendent of Police  Amravati (Rural)  Hari Balaji  the project was implemented in the areas covered by police stations at Paratwada  Anjangaon (Surji)  Warud  Dattapur  Daryapur and Teosa between September 8 and October 30  covering over 20 000 students from 23 schools studying in fifth to tenth class. “We organised webinars for the students  where they were initially given a question paper to check their awareness about the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. It was followed by an interactive online awareness session about the provisions of the Act. We then asked them to answer another question paper to find out if the awareness programme helped increase their understanding. The results were very encouraging. Before the awareness session  they scored 55 per cent on an average but after it the average score rose to 85 per cent ” Balaji told The Indian Express. He added: “The whole session would last about 45 minutes  during which a 20-minute video explaining the provisions of the POCSO Act would be played out. We also gave prizes to top scorers and chocolates to others.” “Interestingly  a similar programme was taken for journalists in Amravati — as part of the press briefing about the programme — where the initial and final scores were not much different ” Balaji said. Appreciated by the police brass  the programme has now been taken up by the state police for implementation across the state. Balaji said  “We are going to undertake similar awareness campaigns for students about other Acts like those concerning women’s issues like dowry  sexual exploitation and abuse  domestic violence  acid attacks  immoral trafficking  Preoccupation and Parental Diagnostic Techniques Act  Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act  IT and other cyber crime Acts  Motor Vehicles Act  etc.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

He was repeatedly saying ‘my life is under threat’ but to no avail. He repeatedly said that the jailer assaulted him after he asked for access to his lawyers  which was shockingly denied ” she claimed. “He detailed the assault being inflicted on him during this custody and pleaded  hands folded  to the Supreme Court of India for intervention and bail. An innocent man and journalist of decades of repute  a journalist doing his duty for the nation  has been assaulted  harassed and framed on fake charges. He has been thrown into jail with no reprieve ” she further said.

I humbly appeal to the institutions that still hold truth to power and stand tall as a pillar of our great democracy to take note of the gross abuse and misuse of power at play to punish a journalist who demanded accountability. A precedent is being set today for our democracy.

68,Amid growing backlash from the opposition BJP  Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said that his government will soon reopen places of worship across the state after Diwali and is ready to face any criticism for the welfare of his state till then. The chief minister also urged citizens to avoid burning fire crackers and continue wearing masks during the festive period. In a public address via video-conferencing  Thackeray said: “We will open the temples and places of worship soon. Let Diwali be over. But even when we open the temples  you can leave your chappals [slippers] outside but not your mask.” Thackery said he has been deliberately delaying the opening of places of worship as many senior citizens frequent them. “After Diwali  we will prepare the guidelines for opening the temples. Let those criticising me continue to do so. I will face all criticisms for the safety of my Maharashtra.” While referring to the spike in cases in the national capital  Thackeray said: “Cases in Delhi have increased because of pollution that weakens the respiratory system. We could have banned firecrackers but we are not doing that. You have always listened to me and I know you will continue to do that. Celebrate Diwali  light lamps but avoid firecrackers.” He added: “Those not wearing masks will be fined. Doctors have said that one infected person without a mask can infect 400 others.” As many as 150 fatalities were reported from the state on Saturday. Cautioning against a second wave of the virus  he said: “We have to be very cautious. The numbers are on a decline but from what we are seeing in the western countries is that when the second wave comes  it’s not a wave  it’s a tsunami.” The chief minister also said that the government will not dismantle the Covid centres and hospitals but raised concerns over the shortage of healthcare workers. “We have opened almost everything and the economic activity is picking up pace. About local trains  we are in talks with the Centre. Piyush Goyal ji has been very cooperative. As we get clearances from the Centre  we will proceed towards starting local trains also ” he added. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

On Saturday  a division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik after a day-long hearing in the pleas reserved its order without granting any immediate relief. Goswami and the other accused – Feroze Shaikh and Nitish Sarda – had challenged their “illegal arrest” and sought to be released on interim bail.

70,The Raigad Police have said in their revision appeal that the court order accepting the “A” summary closure report filed last year by the investigating officer in the abetment to suicide case of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud is “void’ since his family’s response was not taken. In their appeal filed before the sessions court in Alibag  the Raigad Police have said that before accepting the closure report  the magistrate should have issued a notice to the complainant  Naik’s wife  Akshata  as required by law. “No notice was issued to the complainant  nor was she given an opportunity to give her say to the report. This renders the entire proceedings allowing the closure report as void. Therefore  the police were not required to take permission from the court to continue with the probe in the case but only inform it which was done ” the appeal says. The Raigad police say that a letter was sent to the court on October 15 regarding continuation of the probe. Naik’s daughter Adnya had said in a press conference after the arrests that last year she and her mother had met the investigating officer  Suresh Varade  in Alibag. They alleged that he had asked them to sign a statement that they wanted to take the complaint back and had torn the statement when they tried to take a photograph of it. Varade is facing a departmental probe for “wilful omission of facts”. His closure report had said that the three men named in the FIR had no link between them and there was no evidence regarding their involvement in the offence. The Raigad Police have filed an appeal against the order of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) passed on Wednesday not granting police custody of Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and two others — Firoze Shaikh and Nitesh Sarda — arrested in the case. The CJM had said that the arrests were “prima facie illegal” and that the Raigad Police had not taken the court’s permission to reopen a closed case. The Bombay High Court on Saturday while hearing a connected matter also raised a query about whether the closure report could have been accepted without informing the complainant and giving her an opportunity to file a protest petition. The appeal filed by the Raigad Police through the newly appointed special public prosecutor Pradip Gharat further says that the court’s order refusing to grant custody is “illegal and incorrect” and hence should be set aside. The court had said that the police did not establish a link between the deaths of Naik and his mother Kumud and also did not provide valid reasons for grant of police custody. The appeal says that the police have recorded statements of 17 witnesses so far  including under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code  before the magistrate stating that this shows that the court was in the know about the probe. It claimed that the probe also included the analysis of over 2 lakh files found in the hard disk and laptop of Naik. The appeal says that the custodial interrogation of the three is necessary for further investigation  which was not considered. While a say on the appeal is yet to be filed  the plea filed before HC by Goswami says that a “decisively closed case has been reopened with the sole purpose of misusing power  concocting facts and forcefully arresting the petitioner (Goswami) in a prima facie act of revenge and vengeance for his news coverage which questioned those in power in the state of Maharashtra.” The arguments on the appeal which began on Saturday will continue on Monday before the Alibag sessions court. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

71,The Bombay High Court on Saturday issued notices to Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh and two other officers to respond to the plea by Hansa Research Group  seeking the transfer of ‘TRP scam’ case probe from the Mumbai Police Crime Branch to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). As interim relief  the court directed Mumbai Police to call Hansa’s employees for inquiry only two days in a week for a ‘reasonable time’ until the next hearing. A division bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik was hearing a plea by Hansa Research Group  complainant in the case  which has alleged that its employees were harassed by police officers to make false statements “to suit the designs of the crime branch”. The plea also sought from the court to restrain crime branch officers from summoning Hansa employees. Hansa had added that its employees were being harassed as they had declined to give a statement to the effect that a purported “Hansa report” that was being reported by Republic TV was fake. Along with Mumbai Police commissioner  the petition named Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze and Assistant Police Commissioner Shashank Sandbhor as allegedly harassing Hansa employees. “This is a unique situation where the first informant in the crime is being harassed by the investigating agency and treated like an accused only for a false statement …petitioners are being used by police and media to attack each other ” the plea said. The plea also alleged that Vaze and crime branch officers have started ‘a campaign of making statements to the media based on false and unverified facts’. On Saturday  senior counsel C S Vaidyanathan for Hansa Research submitted that it did not make sense for the police to call the petitioner’s employees everyday for questioning and Hansa is ready to provide any document required by the crime branch. He said that police were ‘unnecessarily’ calling and keeping the staff for inquiry for nearly seven to eight hours a day. Senior advocate Devadatt Kamat for Mumbai Police commissioner refuted the allegations and said that the petitioner was being ‘unfair’ with the court and was playing ‘hide and seek’ with the investigation. Justice Shinde said that it will examine submissions by the petitioner and said  “…in the interregnum  you (police) cannot call them (Hansa employees) everyday. They are complainants not accused.” “We are not harassing them  we will strictly investigate. They should not dictate timings ” Kamat responded. “It does not mean you keep them for inquiry from morning to evening. Keep some fixed timing till the next date of hearing ” Justice Shinde said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

73,The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has fined at least 2.26 lakh people across the city for not wearing face masks in public places. As much as Rs 4.7 crore has been collected as fines during the pandemic  officials said. On Friday alone  the civic body penalised 9 983 people for not wearing masks  and collected fines worth Rs 19.9 lakh. Each person is fined Rs 200 for not wearing masks in public places. Most defaulters are found in market areas and shops  where overcrowding is noted. Civic officials said Kurla  which falls under the L Ward  has been the most non-compliant. Dr Jeetendra Jadhav  medical officer  L Ward  said the population density of the ward is high  with 80 per cent of it being covered by slums. “We have been counselling people to wear masks and ensure physical distance…” Jadhav said. The ward has been testing 1 000 people per day  which is higher than BMC’s target of 500 people per ward per day. The civic body has also initiated antigen testing of asymptomatic people  who may be carriers of the virus without their knowledge  and can infect senior citizens. After Kurla  Andheri West recorded the most violations  with 13 099 people being penalised  and fines worth Rs 30 lakh being collected. M-East (Deonar) saw the lowest number of violations  at 3 812. Civic officials said the ward covers mostly the slum population  who cannot afford to pay the fines. Colaba  Churchgate  Santacruz East and Mulund also have low fine collections  perhaps due to better compliance of citizens. On an average  the BMC has been penalising 42 people per day  and collecting around Rs 10 000 as fines per day. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

74,An inquiry committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)  that probed the Apex Hospital fire incident  on Saturday stated that “prima facie  there is no negligence” on the hospital’s part. Members of the committee told The Indian Express that the hospital had followed protocol possible at the time of transferring patients. The members of the BMC inquiry committee include the assistant commissioner  a medical officer  the dean of Mulund Jumbo facility and an official from the civic body’s mechanical and engineering department. A committee members said that they had inspected the hospital generator  the transfer procedure and taken statements from other hospitals to where the patients had been shifted. Two of the patients had died following the transfer. On the evening of October 12  Mulund-based Apex hospital had to transfer 38 of its Covid-19 patients to eight hospitals after its overheated generator had caught fire in the hospital’s compound. The hospital had been running on a generator since 10 am that morning  following a power outage across the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Around 5.30 pm  the generator caught fire  shutting down power supply to the hospital’s ventilators and intensive care units (ICUs). Hospital records showed that at the time of the incident  there were 10 critical patients on ventilator support  three patients on high flow nasal cannula and 10 patients on normal oxygen support. The hospital had arranged for ambulances and transferred patients to other hospitals by night. Two patients  Pandurang Dattatrey Kulkarni (84) and Virendra Singh (54)  had died soon after their transfer to Fortis Hospital. While Kulkarni was already critical  Singh was stable but had shown low pulse rate and oxygen saturation levels after the transfer procedure and had to be put on a ventilator. He died a few hours later. In a statement  Fortis Hospital had maintained that Singh “was brought to us in a critical state without BiPap (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure)  with rapid and shallow breathing  he was also restless  disoriented (he was restrained) and hypoxic (sic).” However  Singh’s son  Krishna Singh said that he plans on lodging a case against Apex Hospital. In its inspection  the four-member BMC committee found that Apex Hospital had purchased a secondhand generator for usage during power failure. The generator had worked for over seven hours before it got overheated and caught fire. “The generator was six to eight years old and in poor condition. Apart from that  we did not find any major faults in the system ” said a committee member  adding that the transfer process had no major discrepancy. BMC Additional Municipal Commissioner  Suresh Kakani said  “The report is almost ready. We are waiting for it before taking a further call.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

75,Continuing its attack on the BJP over the Metro car shed issue  the Congress on Saturday said the Devendra Fadnavis-led government had insisted on the usage of land in Aarey for the car shed with the intent to commercially exploit it in the immediate future. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that while only 20 hectares of land were required for the car shed  the state earmarked 62 hectares  and had plans to commercially exploit the remaining land. He added that because of this  the proposal for building a car shed on the Kanjurmarg site was deliberately rejected by the Fadnavis-led government. Sawant said the Technical Committee  set up by the Fadnavis government to evaluate the project  had recommended to the state that if the Kanjurmarg land was not allotted for the project  it should use 20.82 hectares of Aarey land  instead of 30  to save trees. He claimed that while the government was insisting the project would only use 25 hectares  in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court in 2019  the actual area was shown as 61.6 hectares. He added that the previous government should come clear on what it was planning to do with the additional 40 hectares of land. Sawant also said that as per the minutes of Fadnavis’ war room meeting  procured under RTI  the Urban Development Department had been directed to reserve 30 hectares of land in Aarey  to be earmarked for car depot and ancillary work. He claimed that the minutes showed that directions were passed that the ancillary work could be expanded in the future to commercial activity. The BJP  meanwhile  dismissed these allegations  and said the decision of commercially exploiting Aarey land was taken by the Prithviraj Chavan-led Congress government. “It was Prithviraj Chavan who  in March 2014  decided to hand over Aarey land to the MMRDA at a nominal rate for the Metro project  and allowed commercial exploitation ” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar. “Devendra Fadnavis shot down this proposal in 2017 and made it clear that the land would only be used for Metro-related work  and that no commercial exploitation could take place on said land.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

76,The BJP is finding it tough to strike a balance between loyalists and outsiders in the State Legislature Council polls. Former Congress minister Harshvardhan Patil  who joined the BJP ahead of the 2019 Assembly elections  is vying for the Pune Graduate constituency. However  state BJP leaders find themselves in a dilemma  as inhouse aspirants too are laying claim on the seat. Former BJP minister Subhash Deshmukh is trying to push the candidature of his son Rohan Deshmukh for the Pune Graduate constituency. The elections are scheduled on December 1. The Pune Graduate constituency has become a talking point in the Maharashtra BJP. State BJP president Chandrakant Patil shares an emotive bond  having been elected from this seat twice in the past to become MLC. In 2019  he made a debut in the Assembly polls contesting from Kothrud. The decision led to dislodging of sitting MLA Medha Kulkarni. A section within the BJP had urged Kulkarni to show patience then with a promise that she would be rewarded in the state council. Now  Kulkarni  who has served as professor  is staking claim on the most sought-after seat. Insiders in the BJP indicated that if the party denies her the seat  Kulkarni could explore alternatives in other parties like the MNS. BJP sources claimed Patil loyalist Shekhar Charegaonkar could emerge a dark horse. The state party president is keen on his candidature. Officially  nobody in the party is willing to speak on the final list of candidates for five graduate and teachers constituencies polls. According to Patil  “The core committee of the BJP will take the final decision. The decisions are collective. It’s not decided by any one person.” Union Minister for Surface Transport Nitin Gadkari and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis will have to strike a consensus on the candidate for Nagpur Graduate constituency. Highly placed sources said the BJP finds itself caught between Gadkari  who wants to give a second term to sitting MLA Anil Sole  and Fadnavis  who wants to give chance to former NGP mayor Sandeep Joshi. Both Sole and Joshi are party loyalists. A senior general secretary requesting anonymity said  “Whenever we have to select candidates there are always more candidates than seats…” He indicated that in almost every constituency the scenario is no different. The elections for three graduate constituencies slated are Nagpur  Pune and Aurangabad. Elections for two teachers constituencies scheduled are for Pune and Amravati divisions. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

In a virtual meeting hosted with Gaikwad  state Education Minister Bacchu Kadu and Additional Chief Secretary Vandana Krishna  among others  Thackeray said  “Given the present situation  a second wave of coronavirus cannot be ruled out. There is a need to be cautious for some days after Diwali. The schools that had been converted into quarantine centres cannot be re-converted at the moment. Local administration should take a decision whether schools can be started at alternate places in such a situation.” Thackeray emphasised the need to follow precautions such as the sanitisation of school premises and health checkups of teachers. He stated that those students who are ailing  or have ailing members at home  should not be sent to schools by their parents in this period. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

78,The Maharashtra government on Saturday cracked down on Maratha organisations that had planned agitations called ‘Akrosh Morcha’ or ‘Mashal Morcha’. Activists had earlier in the day assembled at the temple town Pandharpur. They were to march from Pandharpur to the Mantralaya in Mumbai. However  the state government implemented Section 144 disallowing assembly of more than five persons. The police detained activists on the spot. Shiv Sangram president Vinayak Mete said  “The government was suppressing the rights of Marathas. The agitation was peaceful. It was to demand the long pending right of reservation. We believe Congress minister Ashok Chavan  who heads the cabinet sub-committee  cannot pursue the matter. He should be divested from the charge of cabinet sub-committee head on Maratha reservation.” In Mumbai  Maratha Kranti Morcha activists assembled at the collector’s office in Bandra. They were to march up to Matoshree  the residence of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. They wanted to submit a memorandum to the CM.

79,Showik Chakraborty  arrested in a drugs case linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death  has once again sought bail from a special court here  citing a recent Supreme Court order. This is Showik’s third attempt to seek bail since his arrest by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in September. Earlier  the special court as well as the Bombay High Court had rejected his bail pleas. In the application filed recently before the special court hearing cases related to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act  Showik relied on a recent apex court judgment  which says that “confessional statements” made to the NCB officials cannot be considered as evidence. “The Supreme Court  in its recent order rightly held that the officers who are invested with powers under section NDPS Act (pertaining to the current case) are police Officers within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Act. As a result  any confessional statement made to them cannot be taken into account in order to convict an accused under the NDPS Act ” Showik said in his plea. As per section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act  no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence  it said. “In view of the apex court’s judgment  there has been an obvious change in circumstance which would warrant a fresh consideration for bail ” the plea  filed through his advocate Satish Maneshinde  said. In the application  Showik reiterated that he has been “falsely implicated” in the case. The accused has been booked under section 27(A) mechanically and without application of mind  it said. The plea said that the remand applications produced thus far are completely silent as to any allegation of harbouring of offenders as mentioned under Section 27A of the NDPS Act. It claimed the case of the NCB was silent on the amount of financing  quantum of drugs and type of drugs allegedly procured and financed by Showik. The probe agency’s case  in layman terms  is that Showik used to co-ordinate the delivery of drugs for the late Sushant Singh Rajput. In essence  his alleged role  if any  is the purchase of a small quantity of drugs for the late actor. Hence  the allegations against him are is bailable in nature  the plea said. It alleged that the probe agency spun a false narrative that portrays Showik as being someone who finances and procures drugs. The matter is likely to be heard next week  Maneshinde said. The agency has alleged said that actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik used to facilitate drug deliveries and payment through credit cards  cash and other payment gateways. The NCB is probing multiple drug angles linked to Singh’s death. It began its investigation after the Enforcement Directorate (ED)  which was probing money laundering charges linked to Rajput’s death case  shared some social media chats retrieved from Rhea Chakrabortys mobile phone  hinting at the alleged use of banned drugs. Rhea  who was also arrested by the NCB in September  was released on bail last month. Rajput was found hanging at his residence in suburban Bandra on June 14  2020. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

83,The Bombay High Court Thursday quashed an order by the Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC) that imposed a fine of Rs five lakh on TV Today network for alleged “viewership malpractice” and violation of the Council’s code of conduct. The BARC order was based on a show-cause notice to TV Today  alleging that there was “a significant abnormal jump” in the daily average reach of its channels without any distribution improvement. It had said that the same may be due to influencing the panel households which was strictly prohibited by the Code of Conduct related to redressing viewership malpractices. A division bench of Justice Nitin M Jamdar and Justice Milind N Jadhav passed order on November 5 on TV Today’s plea against a July 31 BARC Disciplinary Council order and warning letter imposing the deposit on the network after BARC’s counsel told the court that it was ready to give the company a fresh hearing. TV Today had also sought interim protection against any possible coercive action by the BARC against it. Senior Counsel Veerendra Tulzapurkar along with advocates Abhinav Chandrachud  Munaf Virjee and Akash Agarwal for the petitioner argued that the Disciplinary Council did not have appropriate quorum when the order was passed and therefore it needed to be set aside. Senior advocate Gopal Jain and advocate Ashish Kamat for BARC told the court that there is a new Code of Conduct for ‘Redressing Viewership Malpractices’ and that the BARC was not averse to giving fresh hearing to the TV Today Network. The BARC lawyers had also raised preliminary objection and said that the plea was not maintainable before the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. Senior Counsel Tulzapurkar for petitioner also expressed willingness to appear before the Disciplinary Council for the fresh hearing. In light of these submissions  the bench noted  “As a consequence of this consensus  the petition is disposed of by quashing and setting aside the impugned orders and that the petitioner will appear before the Disciplinary Council on the date assigned. Order accordingly.” The HC on October 27 directed TV Today Network Ltd to deposit with it the Rs 5 lakh imposed on it by the BARC in lieu of protection from possible coercive action. Senior Counsel Tulzapurkar urged that the amount deposited be refunded to the petitioner  which the court accepted and said  “Considering the fact that the Petition is disposed of in the above circumstances and that the amount was deposited pursuant to the interim order  the request made by the Petitioner is reasonable. The Petitioner is permitted to withdraw the amount of Rs. 5 lakh stated to be deposited in the Registry of this Court.” The bench added  “We make it clear we have not gone into the merits of the case and we leave the issue of maintainability (of the plea) open.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

84,Twenty days after the body of a missing Covid-19 patient was recovered from Sewri TB hospital’s toilet in Mumbai  a Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation-appointed probe committee has recommended a string of actions  including the removal of the hospital’s medical superintendent. On October 18  the body of tuberculosis (TB) patient Suryabhan Yadav (27)  who had also tested positive for Covid-19  was found in the hospital toilet a fortnight after he was reported missing from his cot. For 14 days  the body remained inside one of the three toilet cubicles  eventually decomposing and starting to stink. The inquiry committee  headed by BMC Deputy Executive Health Officer Dr Daksha Shah questioned nearly 200 people  including patients  staffers  doctors  nurses and those attached to the hospital administration. It has found lack of supervision and negligence in monitoring of patients. Patients in ward 12  where Yadav was admitted  complained of unbearable stench for days. They said that they had complained many times but no staffer was willing to inspect the source of the smell. The nurses and ward boys had attributed the stench to clogged drains or garbage dumped behind the hospital building. The report  submitted to BMC on Friday  has been sent to the municipal commissioner for approval  following which appropriate action will be initiated. A civic official said that “major changes have been proposed” in the hospital. While action has been proposed against medical officers on duty when Yadav went missing  a departmental inquiry has been advised against nurses and ward boys on duty on October 4. Yadav had moved to Mumbai from Mirzapur for a job in September. He was admitted in a Goregaon hospital after he fell ill. As he tested positive for TB and Covid-19  he was referred to Sewri hospital on September 30. In the wee hours of October 4  he was reported missing and a police complaint was filed by the hospital. His father was informed about his death on October 19  a day after his decomposed body was found in hospital toilet. A source from the hospital said that a medical officer had written in Yadav’s file to check the toilets when he went missing but the instruction was not followed. It is common for Covid-19 patients to collapse if they walk without oxygen support. Patients at Sewri hospital have complained that they were neither provided bed pan nor any aid from the staff to visit toilets in the Covid-19 ward. Several on oxygen support walked to the toilets. The inquiry committee opined that “there was lack of supervision” on part of Superintendent Dr Lalitkumar Anande. A senior BMC official said they have advised that Anande be removed. When contacted  58-year-old Anande said  “I don’t know about the content of the report.” Set to retire next month  he added that he was on duty at the hospital despite being in the high-risk category for Covid-19. Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said  “We have taken serious note of this incident. The final approval on the report will come from the commissioner.” The RAK Marg police  which is investigating the matter  is expected to submit its report by next week. “Our inquiry is in the last stage. We have recorded the statement of the hospital staffers and will submit a report to the BMC commissioner next week ” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone IV) Vijay Patil said. An officer said  “We are investigating the matter from the criminal angle and trying to ascertain whether there was any foul play. We will ask the BMC committee to hand us a copy of its report.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

85,A writ petition was filed by the father of a 32-year-old convict  who died by suicide in Nashik central prison last month  seeking the registration of an FIR against the five prison officials named by him in the suicide note. Asgharali Mansoori was found dead in a cell of the jail on October 7. During the postmortem  a note was found in his abdomen  which named five officials  stating that he was harassed by them. The petition filed by Mansoori’s father  Mumtaz  and People’s Union for Civil Liberties  states that as his father he has the right to know the circumstances that led to the death of his son. While an Accidental Death Record was filed by the Nashik police  an FIR is yet to be filed. The petition seeks that the allegations in the note be thoroughly investigated in a time-bound manner and the prison officials be suspended. The petition also seeks that an independent and impartial body probe into the incident. After his death  at least five prisoners lodged at the jail had also written a letter detailing the alleged harassment Mansoori faced. They had also sought for their statements to be recorded by the magistrate. The petition says that their statements were not recorded by the police yet and sought that they should be provided protection and shifted to another jail in the state. The petition says that the family suspects foul play including the fact that Mansoori was kept in a separate cell for six months as “punishment” in violation of prison rules. Mansoori was convicted in a murder case and had spent nearly 14 years in jail. The petition says that not investigating the death is a violation of fundamental rights. The petition has named the state Home department and the SP of Nashik jail as respondents. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA)  which is implementing metro lines 4 and 4A  said the credit package is made up of one development loan of 345 million euro  including 255 million euro to buy rolling stock  and another promotional loan of 200 million euro. A sum of 90 million euro will be used for a multi-modal integration system  it said. The 545 million euro loan package of KfW is the highest amount given to India ever  that too at the lowest rate of interest offered by any financial institution so far  it added. The interest rates vary between 0.07% and 0.82%. Mumbai line 4 stretches from Wadala to Kasaravadavli  while line 4A is from Kasaravadavli to Gaimukh. The two lines  around 35 kilometre long  will help connect the island city to Thane. The project cost of the two lines will be about Rs 23 000 crore and the KfW’s loan will amount to roughly Rs 4 000 crore. “Although it is good to start mega transportation projects  it is more important to do financial closures and provide support to project authorities – such as making available the required land – without which projects can’t be completed ” said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. The MMRDA has claimed that the two metro lines are likely to ferry 13-14 lakh people once complete. About 21% of civil work on line 4 and six percent of civil work on line 4A are now complete. “The MMRDA is also working for mitigation of climate change by executing metro projects across the Mumbai metropolitan region. Once metro lines 4 and 4A begin operations  it will help save up to 1 21 000 tonnes of greenhouse gases every year ” said MMRDA Commissioner RA Rajeev. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

87,After the Supreme Court served a showcause notice to the Secretary of the Maharashtra Assembly for his letter to television anchor Arnab Goswami purportedly objecting to disclosing House proceedings to the Supreme Court  a senior Assembly Secretariat official said there had been no violation of norms. “We have acted as per the laid procedures ” the official said  requesting that he not be identified. On September 16  during a curtailed two-day monsoon session of the state legislature  the Assembly Secretariat had sought a written response from Goswami within a week over a breach of privilege motion against him. Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik moved the breach of privilege taking objection to the manner in which Goswani referred to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other ministers in his television programmes about actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death. As per norms  the state legislative Secretariat provided the proceedings of Assembly relating to breach of privilege motion  to enable him to prepare his defence  the official said. However  the official said  it came to their notice that instead of responding to the breach of privilege motion  Goswami had tagged the Assembly proceedings to his petition in the Supreme Court against the motion. As per process  Assembly proceedings are confidential  and the Speaker’s permission is necessary before using it in any matter  according to officials  who said Goswami had not obtained this permission. On October 13  the state legislature Assembly Secretary served a second notice to Goswami  asking why he had submitted the Assembly proceedings in Supreme Court without permission of Assembly Speaker Nana Patole. Goswami was told to give in writing his explanation by October 16. State legislature Assembly Secretary Rajendra Bhagwat refused to comment on the developments. Bhagwat said  “I am in Nagpur. I have come here along with my officers for a meeting to review the pre-winter session. I have not seen the SC notice and would not like to comment.” Officials in the state legislature Secretariat indicated that Patole would be the appropriate authority to make an official statement on the matter. Patole was not available for comment. However  a senior official associated with working of state legislature Assembly and Council said  “The notice sent to Goswami was confined only to asking him why he had tagged the Assembly proceedings to his petition. First notice was to get his response on breach of privilege. Second notice was why he submitted Assembly proceedings in SC without taking proper permission from Speaker.” The Privileges Committee held its preliminary meeting on Thursday and discussed the matter. But there was no decision taken or order issued to arrest Goswami  said officials. Nor was he questioned for filing an appeal in SC. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

88,The three-judge bench (full bench) of the Bombay High Court on Friday held that prisoners convicted under the Protection of Children from the Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act cannot avail emergency parole in view of Supreme Court’s directions to decongest jails due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The full bench said newly introduced Rule 19 (1) (C) of Maharashtra Prisons (Mumbai Furlough and Parole) Rules  which restricted grant of emergency parole to convicts under special laws  covers POCSO Act. The court on Thursday had concluded hearing of the reference made to it by a two-judge division bench to decide whether prisoners convicted under POCSO Act can avail emergency parole. On November 3  the full bench comprising Justice K K Tated  Justice G S Kulkarni and Justice N R Borkar had expanded the scope of the case and said it would decide whether emergency parole can be extended to convicts not only under POCSO Act but also under all special Acts like Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA)  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA)  among others. The reference to the full bench was made by Justice S S Shinde and Justice M S Karnik  who last month had ruled on a plea by a 31-year-old man  convicted for raping a minor and booked under POCSO Act  seeking release on emergency parole due to Covid-19. The HC said on Friday  “The reference as made in the rule to certain special Acts is certainly not exhaustive and would include within its ambit other similar Acts where the offences are serious. The reference to special Acts like MCOC  PMLA  MPID  NDPS and UAPA is required to read ejusdem generis (of similar class). The court cannot be oblivious that when the accused is sentenced for seven years and above under the provisions of the POCSO Act  it is certainly a conviction for a serious offence affecting the society at large.” “We are not inclined to accept the contentions… that merely because POCSO Act is not found in the special Acts as referred in the proviso  the prisoners convicted under the Act can avail benefit of emergency parole ” it added. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

89, Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol has appealed to residents to avoid firecrackers in view of the possible second wave of Covid.  Mohol said  “The central government team that visited Pune has stated of a possible second surge of Covid cases in December and January. As bursting of firecrackers cause respiratory-related problem  it also generate aerosols which may transmit Covid virus more rapidly. Some states have already taken a decision to ban firecrackers during Diwali. Hence  citizens on their own need to take necessary care and avoid firecrackers this seson.”  The mayor said that as the Mumbai municipal corporation has taken some decisions regarding firecrackers  the Pune counterpart has sought the details and could issue guidelines likewise.  “I request traders and kids who burst crackers during the festival  mainly on Laxmi Puja  to keep it at a minimum level as it will badly affect those with respiratory issues ” he said.  A civic official on condition of anonymity said  “With many restrictions already in place due to the Covid situation  we have only made a public appeal to avoid use of crackers instead of banning it. As it is  there is no mechanism to check citizens using firecrackers during the festival.”  Meanwhile  the civic administration has already put in place many checks and guidelines for crackers sellers to put up roadside stalls in an effort to bring down supply numbers.  NCP demands ban on cracker sale  Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) spokesperson Ankush Kakade has demanded the state ban on sale of firecrackers in view of the Covid situation. Kakade has written to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar to take the decision as carried out by Delhi and other states.  ,pune,ht
90,The Covid-19 lockdown had everyone house-bound  that means parked cars were left for a long period of time in the company of rodents causing massive damage to cables of vehicles. Automobile service stations across city are coming across dozens of cases where rodents - rats  mice - have chewed wires and caused damaged worth lakhs of rupees to the owners. Neeraj Bhide  a resident of Prabhat road  had to spend Rs 1 40 000 to replace wiring and radiator fan of his luxury four-wheeler. “My car was parked at Prabhat road for the three months. In May  when the restrictions were eased while driving  I came to know that the engine temperature of my vehicle is very high as the radiator fan was not working ” said Bhide  a working professional. It was the first time Bhide has come across to such damage to his cars. “If your car is standing for a long period then such damage happens ” explained Bhide. Ashwin Apte  who runs Apte Shri Auto Service  near MIT College Kothrud  said  “Such problem arises only when the car is standing at one place for many days. Generally  rats are found in parking areas and after lockdown  many of our clients are facing similar problems.” The rats have either eaten wires in the engine compartment or have chewed cable of air condition and seat covers were also damaged. “Out of seven cars which we get to repair in a day  four-five cars have a problem of wire damages. Price of every wire varies  but on an average minimum one has to spend Rs10 000 to fix the wire connection ” added Apte. Another resident of Mumbai  who came to Pune  also faced the same problem  though he was lucky enough to drive safely to the city before he came to know that the wires of the car were damaged. Since March 2020 when the first lockdown was announced  his car was stationed at his car-park at Mumbai’s Malad West  located along the suburban railway track. “After coming to Pune  the mechanic detected that there was a short circuit of wiring inside the bonnet which happened due to chewing of wires. The manufacture had stopped the production of this particular model and so I preferred to book a new car for delivery during the upcoming Diwali rather than getting it repaired for a high estimate that the auto-mechanic had offered ” said the resident requesting anonymity. Another auto mechanic from Pimpri-Chinchwad said  though rats are smaller creatures  the damage they cause is immense  particularly when the vehicle is parked unattended for a longer period. “Such cases have increased during the lockdown as vehicles were parked for a longer period. In the past too we have attended similar problems ” said  Mahendra Patil  an auto-mechanic. Rishab Pokarna  a resident of Chakan  who faced a similar problem is still clueless about how much he will have to spend to repair his vehicle. “I was not in Pune during till last month so from around May  my car was parked in the society parking. On Sunday (November 1) when I tried to restart my car  it did not start and I had to tow my car and now how many wires have been damages is still not known ” he said. ,pune,ht
91, Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic  academia has taken a hit in Maharashtra.  A total of 35 000 seats of the Right to Education (RTE) have remained vacant in the state this year.  Until now 79 580 students have confirmed their admissions of the total 1 00 926 seats selected for RTE admissions for the academic year 2020-21.  The state primary education department has now given a one-week extension for waiting list students to complete the admission process  as most of the parents couldn’t complete their admission process.  “The first lottery of RTE admissions was announced on March 17  the admission process of students selected in this lottery was going on until September 27. After which from September 30 to October 29  the admission process of students in the waiting list was done. However  more than 35 000 seats remained vacant under the RTE  so it was decided to extend the waiting list students’ admission process by one more week ” said Dinkar Patil  state primary education department director.  This year due to the Covid-19 pandemic  the RTE admission process was delayed. In 9 331 RTE registered schools in the state for this year  a total of 1  15 460 RTE vacancies existed.  Of the 2  91 368 applications  1 00 926 students were selected.  Whereas in Pune district in 972 RTE registered schools for the year  there were 16 949 RTE vacancies. There were 62 919 applications  and16 617 students were selected and as of today 11 146 students have confirmed the admission. Due to various reasons and issues parents were not able to complete the admission process under RTE.  “The admission of my daughter was completed in the waiting list of the RTE  but we had to wait until October for it. The school which we got the admission and its staff didn’t cooperate with parents and called us several times demanding for various documents.” said Shweta Jagdale  a parent.  ,pune,ht
92,Pune mayor Murlidhar Mohol on Tuesday resolved to take action against those responsible for not executing ducts as part of the 24x7 water pipeline project  despite a work order.  Mohol said  “It is true that as the ruling party we are responsible for this but it is not our work to check the work on the ground. We elected members approved the policy to lay the ducts along with the 1 700km water pipeline. Even the general body gave a nod for it and approved Rs195 crore for the ducts. It is the municipal administration and municipal commissioner’s responsibility to check whether the work is going on as per the work order or not.”  The mayor who warned of strict action said he was informed of the lapses in the construction only a few days ago and has called a meeting with selected officers for the same.  “There are two groups within the administration and they are intentionally not doing the duct work despite being instructed by the general body. I would ensure that there would be ducts along with the water pipeline and have called a meeting for the same very soon ” he said.  PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said  “It is shocking. I have instructed the administration to present a detailed report on it. Why has the duct work not been carried out? Has the administration taken permission from elected members to put this work on hold?”  The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) approved the 24x7 water scheme in February 2018. Earlier it cost Rs 3 000 crore. After a lot of opposition by various NGOs and politicians  the cost of the project came down by Rs 1 000 crore. As the roads are going to be dug in most parts of the city  the former municipal commissioner had added the component of ducts for laying of optical fibre cables as well.  Earlier the cost was Rs 290 crore  but it was finalised at Rs 195 crore.  In a report on Tuesday  HT highlighted that 300km work of the 24x7 water pipeline was completed  but the ducts have not been built in.  Vivek Velenkar  RTI activist said  “It’s shocking that despite being a tender item  the work of duct has not been carried out. The ducts will give revenue to the PMC and the civic body would not need to dig the roads every year. It is a good chance to construct the ducts in the whole city along with the 24x7 water project. The cost of the duct should be recovered from the guilty person and at any cost  it would not pass on taxpayers.”  Former mayor Prashant Jagtap said it was shocking that despite the ducts being listed as a tender item  the work was ignored.  “I wrote a letter to the municipal commissioner and asked for an inquiry immediately. Even it is the responsibility of the ruling party to check whether the work is carried on the ground or not. As the ruling party did not have control over administration  they surpassed them ” Jagtap said. BJP leader and former opposition leader Ujwal Keskar said  “Action must be taken against all those who are responsible for not doing the duct work despite it being mentioned in the tender.” Shiv Sena leader Prashant Badhe said that the project began in 2018 and after three years  it has been exposed as work on the ducts have not been carried out.  “The administration as well as office bearers are responsible for it. Since the beginning  this scheme is doubtful as it was inflated by almost Rs 1 000 crore. We would raise the voice in the PMC and on the road for not erecting ducts ” Badhe said.  ,pune,ht

95,When I took out my grandma’s 70-year-old turquoise gharara from her trunk  hoping to be able to wear it to a wedding  the sheen of the brocade was intact but the delicate silk kurta and dupatta were in tatters. A designer friend came to the rescue. She made a new blouse with pink and gold gota-patti work and gave me a gold and pink sequinned stole  and voila! She had upcycled an old classic!  “When you take an old or antique garment or even fabric  and give it a twist by adding new elements to make into something new  it is called upcycling ” explains designer Leena Singh  who for the last three decades has been upcycling garments.   “Our arts and craft were always there and will always be. Our weaves and embroidery are part of our heritage. The idea of upcycling is to find and restore these beautiful treasures and take them in a new direction ” says Leena. “The maharanis of yesteryear had beautiful orhnis  lehengas and shawls. To bring them forward and make them relevant for contemporary times is the journey of upcycling.”   Restyling on the other hand means to change the style of a garment without changing its structure.   And in this day and age when fashion is the second biggest polluter with nearly 50 million tons of clothing being discarded every year  upcycling and restyling are truly steps in the direction of mindful and responsible fashion.  “We are drowning the world with our fashion buys and this pandemic has brought the facts home. It has forced us to look at our own fashion footprint and made us realise the consumers are the changemakers ” says Sujata Assomull  Dubai-based fashion journalist and an advocate of mindful fashion.  How can we upcycle and restyle effectively? “Commit yourself to being a repeat offender. Do your shopping when you are in a good frame of mind  not because you are bored or upset. There are lessons to be learnt from our grandmothers  who bought things made of the best fabrics so they could be remodelled into something else ” says Sujata.  To lead by example  we got six stylish men and women to dig out one celebratory garment from their wardrobe. Some of these are upcycled heirloom pieces  some needed basic restyling. All can now be worn again and again!  A Kurta Becomes A Dress Vidushi Mehra  42  Theatre actor “The original kurta that this dress is made from was designed by Shantanu & Nikhil for me to wear at the sangeet of a super exclusive Delhi wedding where singer Usher was performing ” recalls Vidushi Mehra  theatre actor and mentor. “It was about 15 years ago  and I paired it with see-through tights. With an off-shoulder and bold gold motifs  it was considered quite a forward garment at the time  but I got so many compliments that day that I decided to keep this kurta with me for all these years though I’m an absolute non-hoarder.”  Vidushi never wore it again  though the outfit was borrowed by her family and close friends over the years. However  after it was restyled as a dress by the HT Brunch stylist with a pair of chic peep-toes  she fell in love with it all over again. The combination of velvet  gold and black will never go out of fashion  she says. “I’m definitely going to repeat this as a dress now!” Vidushi adds. Fashion advice: “When wearing an outfit with bulky motifs  avoid chunky accessories and too many elements. Keep the look as minimal as possible ” cautions designer Jenjum Gadi. A Sari Draped Differently Yasmin Kidwai  45  Documentary filmmaker “When Sanjay Garg hadn’t yet launched his label 13-14 years ago  I bought this Raw Mango Chanderi sari from him ” says filmmaker and politician Yasmin Kidwai. “I have actually never worn it. My son was just a couple of months old when I bought it and I wasn’t wearing saris then. Then the other baby came and  with two boys  I couldn’t dream of wearing a sari. I take it out lovingly every summer with the intention of wearing it  and then put it back at the end of the season.” So  when this old keepsake was restyled by the HT Brunch stylist with a short blouse and loose pyjamas with delicate embroidery at the bottom  it made a lot of sense to Yasmin. “It was a win-win. My style is not very traditional and dressy  but the casualness and ease of this outfit works for me ” smiles Yasmin. Fashion advice: “Wear it with a crisp cotton shirt with folded sleeves or a belted gilet  with the sari coming out of the neckline ” says designer Varun Rana. A Vintage Jacket Is Young Again Gautam Sinha  40  Fashion entrepreneur & founder  Nappa Dori “I bought this vintage Japanese jacket from a thrift store in Paris on the last day of my trip  10 years ago ” says Gautam Sinha  the owner of luxury leather brand Nappa Dori.  Gautam had gone to Paris for the Maison & Objet fair and had been walking around  looking for inspiration for his brand. “I love old things  and scour the flea markets and thrift stores in every city I visit. I liked its texture and weave and was surprised that it fit me perfectly considering the Japanese are quite small ” he laughs. The jacket comes out of his closet every now and then. This time around  he feels that the styling  which pairs the jacket with the good old jeans-tee-sneaker combo  compliments his personality well with a hint of vintage. Fashion advice: “A turtleneck or polo neck under the jacket can add to its unisex appeal. Accessorise with a chunky silver neckpiece and a thick bangle. Why not be a tad naughty and wear it with a deliberately-loosened tie?” advises veteran designer Madhu Jain. Upcycled And Madeover Dr Deepali Bhardwaj  35  Dermatologist “When I was studying in Pune  I borrowed this sari from my mother to wear for my freshers party but as the colour code required us to wear black  I bought another one and this was made into a dress ” says Dr Deepali Bhardwaj  a renowned dermatologist and laser surgeon.  But Deepali’s mother was not thrilled to have her sari cut up and restyled by a local Parsi tailor. “It was an expensive silk sari that she had bought from Tokyo  and lent to me so lovingly. I never wore it more than once after that ” says Deepali. When this upcyled dress was restyled by our stylist with a scarf and paired with heels  Deepali loved it. “Just this basic restyling has made such a huge difference to my dress; it’s far more wearable ” she says. Fashion advice: “Since this dress is up to the neck  avoid too much bulk there in terms of accessories. It also has a busy print  so either go the maximalist way and play with more prints in outerwear  or go totally minimal and clean ” says celebrity stylist Rishi Raj.  Dad’s Old Bomber Is All New Abhinav Mathur  36  Digital content creator & lawyer When Abhinav Mathur  a digital content creator who is lauded for his fashion sense  borrowed his dad’s heirloom reversible bomber jacket to match with an outfit last year  he didn’t expect to inherit it.  “My dad bought this jacket in Brussels  Belgium  over 10 years ago and has been wearing it extensively since. But a few years ago  he felt he’d outgrown it and just put it away in his cupboard ” says Abhinav. “When I wore it  it fit me perfectly  and he was extremely happy to see that in his late 50s  he was almost as fit as I am in my 30s and happily passed it on to me! I love the colour and the fact that it’s reversible and can be repeated with a whole lot of outfits.” Although Abhinav had stashed this bomber jacket away for some time now  when our team helped him restyle it with a neutral-hued T-shirt  folded pants and sneakers  it gave him new ideas to dress it up! Fashion advice: “A jacket like this one is easy to style in different ways. Just choose your vibe for the day and play with your coordinates. Experiment as much as you like!” says celebrity stylist Rishi Raj.  Mom’s Sari Is A Shirt Krishnendu Choudhury  30  Marketing professional “My mother received this Jamdani sari as a gift at a family wedding. She wore it for 10-12 years and then kept it aside. However  I loved the contrasting colours and decided to make a shirt out of it ” says Krishnendu Choudhury  a marketing professional.  His mother didn’t think it would work – as the sari was too old to be upcycled. When Krishnendu gave it to a local tailor five years ago  the shirt turned out quite nicely.  “I had heard stories of Taslima Nasreen framing pieces of her heirloom saris and giving them to her close friends. I feel proud of our traditional textile weaves and being able to wear the shirt to not-so-traditional events!” he says. With our stylist restyling the sheer shirt with a black ganjee  cool white trousers and brown lace-ups  he’ll start wearing it again. Fashion advice: “Avoid overdoing the look. If it’s the shirt that’s making the statement  then let it do all the talking. And keep the rest of the look simple and sharp ” says designer Karan Torani.

96,Poor hygiene  unsanitary conditions  and lack of clean drinking water could result in fewer deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19)  a new study by Indian researchers suggests. The study by researchers from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)  National Centre for Cell Science  Pune  and the Chennai Mathematical Institute  seems to support the hygiene hypothesis wherein improved immunity is said to be behind people developing a less severe form of the viral disease. Bihar  which faces issues like a lack of clean drinking water facilities  has the Covid-19 case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.5%  as opposed to 1.5% nationally. CFR is defined as the number of deaths due to a particular disease as compared to the number of people suffering from it. Also Read: ‘17% Covid deaths linked to pollution’ Kerala and Assam have a CFR of 0.4%  Telangana 0.5  and Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh 0.9%. CFR of 1% or less is what the Central government is also targeting nationally. In contrast  the researchers’ have highlighted that more developed states of Maharashtra  Gujarat and Punjab have a CFR of 2% or more. Various developmental parameters were looked at as part of the study that includes quality of water and sanitation  and Covid-19 deaths per million population in at least 100 countries. The researchers found that the poorer the water-sanitation quality  the fewer were deaths per million population due to the viral disease as these conditions impacted a person’s overall immunity. Several experts have also been saying that there could be a correlation between lower Covid-19 fatality rate and improved immunity due to the living conditions as a person gets exposed to a variety of disease-causing microbes. “In India  the severity of infection seems to be low because our immunity levels are better modulated to fight off any infections as compared to Europeans and Americans. In fact  other viruses kill more. However  the infectivity rate of this virus is quite high so infections could go up in the future. Deaths will remain low ” said Dr NK Mehra  former head  transplant  immunology and immunogenetics  All India Institute of Medical Science  Delhi. ,pune,ht
97, The study spearheaded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has found that convalescent plasma therapy was not found effective in bringing down mortality rate among Covid-19 patients  city doctors  however  feel that the treatment has been found effective in case of patients with moderate symptoms. Doctors feel that the study had to be wider and also such conclusions can deter doctors from prescribing the therapy while donors might also become reluctant to come forward.  After efforts by the administration to create awareness and encourage Covid-19 survivors to come forward to donate their blood for plasma  which had come up as a promising treatment method  the ICMR study has found that this therapy is not as promising in bringing down the mortality rate. Based on this study  the government is now contemplating removing the therapy as a treatment protocol for Covid-19. However  city doctors believe that such a step might just discourage donors to donate their blood.  Currently  the Pune division has 42 blood banks which have been authorised to collect blood samples for the separation of plasma from people who have recovered from Covid-19. These banks are located in Pune  Pimpri-Chinchwad  Sangli  Satara  Solapur and Kolhapur. The 42 blood banks have received blood donations from about 2 916 donors who have donated a total of 5 875 units of 200ml of blood of which 5 545 have been distributed as of October 24 and currently  there are just 301 units remaining.  Maximum donors have come forward from Pimpri-Chinchwad. Of 2 916 donors  669 donated their blood at PCMC’s YCM hospital while Sassoon  the district’s biggest hospital  has received 136 donors. Professor Dr Rohidas Borse  deputy head of medicine department at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital  said  “We have found that plasma treatment is effective in Covid-19 patients showing moderate symptoms. Depending upon the impact of the virus on the patient’s lungs right from mild  moderate or severe  the treatment protocol is decided. Plasma therapy is found to be effective in those suffering from moderate symptoms as of 70 patients who were given this therapy  it was found to be effective in about 30-40 patients.”  Doctors have also said that currently all the treatment protocols for Covid-19 are experimental  including the drugs being prescribed. Dr Sunil Rao  group medical director of Sahyadri Group of Hospitals  said  “The therapy is found to be effective in those suffering from moderate symptoms. We have stopped prescribing it now  but the final call is of the treating doctor. We have our blood bank where we do get requests for the plasma from other hospitals and relatives keep coming for the same. The therapy has no interference with regards to comorbidity or age and works the same if the therapy is started in the initial days of infection or when moderate symptoms start appearing. Also  it is not a very expensive treatment as the price is capped by the government. The ICMR study needs to be on a wider base with more samples and cases being studied.” Dr Subhash Salunkhe  epidemiologist and chairman  state technical committee on communicable diseases  who heads the committee  said  “The ICMR study has limitations as their sample size is only about 400-500 patients. Such studies need to be carried out on a larger scale and only then can such conclusions be drawn. Plasma therapy is only considered once the tests are considered properly. The therapy is found to be effective in some cases while not in some cases  but then again all the current treatment protocol is only experimental and so it must be left to the wisdom of the treating physician. Also  such statements by an institute like ICMR will only confuse the physicians. Completely ruling out the therapy or treating it as the last stop solution for Covid-19 would be two extremes and so we must keep an open mind and let the clinicians make the decision based on case-to-case situation.”  ,pune,ht

100,Former Bharatiya Janata Party leader Eknath Khadse joined the Nationalist Congress Party  in the presence of NCP chief Sharad Pawar  on Friday  becoming the first seniormost leader from the state BJP unit to make the switch in the past over two decades since the party was formed. Putting speculation to rest  Pawar said there won’t be any change in the NCP’s ministers and Khadse had not sought a ministerial berth while joining the party.  Speaking on the occasion  Khadse issued a veiled threat to his former colleagues  saying he would expose those who have made illegal land deals. “False cases were filed against me that include two cases of corruption by ACB  one at Nashik and another at Pune. A molestation case was also filed against me… I have never used a woman for politics  nor have I stabbed anyone in the back. It is not in my nature ” Khadse said  targeting the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis without taking his name. “Now  I will show who has taken how many plots illegally. People don’t have to wait for long. I will also demand action against those who have violated rules and regulations… If they put ED (Enforcement Directorate) behind me  I will show CD ” said Khadse  on state NCP chief Jayant Patil’s remarks that he may face ED probe after quitting the BJP.  Khadse has been blaming Fadnavis for being neglected in the BJP for the past four years. “Not just my followers  even some BJP leaders advised me to join the NCP. I told them about my condition and asked some senior BJP leaders if I should go to another party. They advised me to join the NCP ” he said.  “Some claimed that Khadse demanded ministerial position in the state government  which is not true. Khadse has not made any demand  nor did we have any discussion on this. He wants to work for people again. No one is going to be made a minister  similarly no one is going to be removed. There will be no changes in the ministerial council. Everybody will work together as a team ” Pawar said.  According to a proposal under consideration  housing minister Jitendra Awhad could be asked to resign and appointed him as the state NCP chief. The NCP will then exchange his portfolio with the Sena  which has the agriculture department. On Friday  agriculture minister Dada Bhuse said he was ready to give up the post if asked by Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Currently  Jayant Patil is holding position of the state unit chief as well as water resources minister in the MVA government.  Reacting to his claims  state BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said  “He is trying to justify his decision of joining the NCP by alleging false cases were filed against him. The truth will come before everyone when the cases come to court. Why is he worried?” He also said the party will react only after Khadse comes out with the revelations on illegal land deals.  On Friday  Khadse said all members from many panchayat samitis  municipal council and others will join the NCP. “I will work even harder for the NCP than I did for the BJP in the past 40 years. Many people who were elected to various bodies didn’t want to join today  but they will come soon ” he said.  Ajit skips party event  Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar  who is virtually number two in the party after NCP chief Sharad Pawar  skipped the event leading to speculations that he was unhappy with the developments. NCP leaders said Ajit Pawar was unwell since Thursday and even got a Covid-19 test done. He tested negative  but has quarantined himself at home as a precautionary measure.  “Some news reports have claimed that Ajit Dada is upset. Why will he be upset? He is only taking precautions which all have been told to follow due to the Covid pandemic. There is nothing to worry ” the NCP chief clarified in his speech. He named NCP ministers who had been infected in the past few weeks and said the latter have chosen to carry out their duties even though it meant meeting people at the risk of getting infected.  ,pune,ht

102,“Come July  and my kids would start wheezing  catch allergies if they are out for too long. Unlike bad water and polluted grounds  the effects of polluted air are not immediately visible. This pandemic has also proven that people who have respiratory issues find it hard to cope with the infection. It’s high time we fight for better breathing rights for our future generations ” says Bhavreen Kandhari  a Delhi-based environmentalist  and mother to twin daughters. She is also a member of Warrior Moms — a pan-India initiative of environmentally conscious mothers who are fighting against air pollution and other environmental issues.  There are more than 1 000 women engaging with the team on a pan India scale  with numbers increasing every day. But  why the name Warrior Moms? Kandhari says it’s because they are now operating on a war scale  and explains that “Mothers will go to all ends of the world for the benefit of their children. The name is a reflection of that commitment. I shiver to think as a mother that I’m packing cigarettes instead of lunch boxes in the school bag; the air our child breathes could be equal to smoking up to 20 cigarettes a day! It is a national emergency.”   During the lockdown and even in phases of unlock  the pollution levels reduced drastically  thus allowing Delhi-NCR residents to breathe in peace. “This is a chance for us to reflect upon the lifestyle choices we make  and also question the government’s decisions that have made the air unbreathable prior to lockdown ” says Anuja Bali Karthikeyan  a Warrior Mom from Pune.  Sherebanu Frosh  a Gurugram-based Warrior Mom who is one of the 50 women at the core of this collective  says  “Coming together and raising voices has always been the only way to make a difference. We felt that if mothers understood the implications of air pollution on their children  they would rise and fight for solutions.”   WHO has pointed out that children  especially below five years  are more vulnerable than ever to the harmful effects of air pollution. Gurugram-based Warrior Mom  Dr Sarika Verma  an ENT surgeon by profession  agrees to this  and says  “We have taken up this cause because we feel authorities are not effectively dealing with this menace. The number of cases of children who now need nebulisers to breathe properly  has increased manifold in Delhi and nearby areas. But our fight isn’t limited to air pollution. We will be championing the cause of waste management  oppose indiscriminate tree felling  and demand cleaner fuel for vehicles among other key issues.”  Talking about the need for appropriate policies to drive a sustained change  Frosh adds that the group is aiming for social media campaigns and conversations with a wider reach. She adds  “Our mission is to push the change in technologies and policies  which are needed to get to a zero emission and AQI 60  for the sake of our children.”  Author tweets @bhagat_mallika Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter ,pune,ht
103,Maharastra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray began his two-day tour of flood-affected districts in western and central Maharashtra on Monday. Thackeray  along with other senior ministers from his cabinet  is visiting villages that were hit by heavy rainfall in Solapur and will meet with district officials on Monday evening to take stock of the situation. Harvest-ready crops on hectares of land were destroyed in the torrential rainfall and flooding that occurred for over four days last week in many districts of central and western Maharashtra. Farmers have been demanding immediate financial relief. Thackeray  along with revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat  relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar  agriculture minister Dadaji Bhuse and local ruling party MLAs began the tour from Sangvi Khurd village in Solapur district. After visiting a few more villages in Akkalkot tehsil  he will hold a meeting with officers at the district collectorate before returning to Mumbai. Also Read: Agri loss unprecedented  says Pawar as he promises to meet PM for Centre’s help for rain-affected areas At Sangvi Khurd  farmers expressed disappointment at the chief minister’s decision to review losses to crops from the bridge on Bhori river instead of visiting the fields. “Rain in our village was unprecedented. We want the entire village to be rehabilitated with immediate assistance to farmers ” said Aftab Shaikh  the village head of Sangvi Khurd. The chief minister’s tour began after criticism from opposition parties that Thackeray should step out and assess the loss from the ground instead of evaluating the situation through video conferencing. The CM will visit flood-hit villages in Osmanabad on Wednesday. Leader of opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis  too  began his three-day tour of flood-hit districts on Monday. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar visited villages in Solapur and Nanded on Sunday as part of his two-day tour.  Pawar  on Sunday  said  the Union government should help flood-affected farmers as the state had limited resources. Pawar also said he would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard in the next 10 days.  “The Centre will  of course  help  but the state government cannot shrug off its responsibility. It is the state government’s primary responsibility to assist ” Fadnavis said while reacting to Sharad Pawar’s remarks.  Fadnavis  during his visit to flood-affected areas in Daund tehsil of Pune district  said there was a “growing tendency” among the Maha Vikas Aghadi government to pass on every responsibility to the Centre. Due to the rain and floods  in western Maharashtra alone  29 people lost their lives while 16 persons died in central Maharashtra’s Aurangabad division and three in coastal Konkan.

The irrigation department is expecting an increase in the irrigated land area and revenue this year as the reservoirs have good water stock  an official told PTI. The Marathwada region comprises Aurangabad  Beed  Hingoli  Jalna  Latur  Nanded  Osmanabad and Parbhani districts. According to a report of the irrigation department released on Sunday  the water stock in nine dams of the region is 5 493.92 MCM (million cubic metres)  which is 98.98 per cent of their total storage capacity. The water stock in these projects last year on this date was 84.03 per cent  the report said.

Last year  we recovered Rs 27 crore as revenue  this year we can expect it to go beyond Rs 30 crore "" he said. Aurangabad-based water conservation expert Pradeep Purandare said there could be a rise in sugarcane cultivation this year due to heavy rains. However  due to water losses in canals  the stock discharged from dams is less likely to reach the desired land areas for irrigation  he added. """,pune,toi

Papiya Bhattacharjee of Balewadi and Nupur Gupta of Undri plan to celebrate the festival of lights with simple decorations and homemade dishes. “Preparations for Diwali have already begun. The entire family is busy with house cleaning. After a long time  I would be celebrating Diwali with my grandparents. I’m excited  though due to safety concerns  we won’t be able to visit our near and dear ones ” said Lamba. “Apart from earthen diyas  lights and rangolis  I usually use flowers to decorate the house. However  this year I have planted flower saplings in my balcony. Additionally  as we could not make a trip to my hometown Alwar  I would be preparing annakoot for my daughter  a traditional dish made up of seasonal vegetables  well-cooked bajra and kadhi  which is made during this time in various parts of Rajasthan ” said Gupta. She feels due to safety restrictions  the festival will lack its usual fun. “Traditionally  there is Diwali Milan in North India. Here also  we visit our friends and neighbours.

I was expecting people would celebrate at home this time but we still have pet occupants… Our animal volunteers are prepared to attend to distress calls ” said Chen. “Some people are still lighting up fireworks. I am worried pets as well as street animals will not have any respite ” said Sharma.

For our patrons we will have a live telecast  so that they can experience it at home. We also have made arrangements for devotees interested to book bhog online ” said Anup Dutta  general secretary at Kalibari. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

111,Sugar millers in Maharashtra seem to be divided on the question of how to pay the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) to farmers for cane procured from them this season. While a few millers in Kolhapur district have already made an announcement about paying the FRP at one go  majority of other millers in the state have decided to pay the FRP in two or three installments. The Sugarcane Control Order 1966 mandates payment of FRP within 14 days of cane delivery. Millers  however  have the option of entering into an agreement with farmers  which would allow them to pay the government-mandated FRP in installments. Late payment of FRP also entails an interest of 15 per cent. While this provision is not new  it has hardly been used in Maharashtra. During the 2014-2015 season  Shiv Sena leader Prahlad Ingole had moved the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court against 20 sugar mills in Nanded division  which had not paid the FRP. Ingole’s plea sought to make the mills pay the FRP plus the interest on late payment. Following this order  sugar millers have started inking agreements with farmers about payment of FRP in three installments. This clause in included in the cane registration form  which farmers sign at the start of the season  when they pledge to sell their cane to the mills. Last season  the then sugar commissioner Saurabh Rao had asked mills to ink separate agreements with their farmers about part payment of FRP. Meanwhile  in a meeting chaired by Kolhapur’s Guardian Minister Satej Patil  a few mills  including the one controlled by Rural Development Minister Hassan Mushrif  have agreed to pay the FRP in one installment for the current season. This has been the demand of farmer’s unions as well as farmer leader Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana. This announcement  however  has not gone down well with most millers  with the neighbouring millers of Sangli district refusing to toe the line. Speaking to The Indian Express  millers from the district said that given the sluggish sales  it was not possible to pay the FRP at one go. “Financial constraints have forced us to enter into agreements with farmers for part payment of FRP. The law allows us to do so ” said a miller from Sangli. The announcement by a few millers  about paying the FRP in one installment  has not recieved much support from other mills  who said they will continue paying as per their agreements. At the start of the season  sugar mills generate capital by pledging their sugar stock with banks. On their part  banks provide capital in the form of 85 per cent of the sugar valuation  which at present is Rs 3 100 per quintal. “So  Rs 2 635 is made available in terms of working capital ” said a miller from Marathwada. Other than the FRP  this has to account for conversion cost (Rs 700  which includes expenses like chemicals  salaries  jute bags etc)  leaving Rs 1 400 available for FRP payment. Cogeneration as well as ethanol generates around Rs 300 extra  so the maximum mills can afford to pay is Rs 1 700. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

112,The recent ‘unlocking’ of cinema halls and theatres in Pune may not lead to a flurry of shows and screenings anytime soon  with many of them opting to stay shut right now for a variety of reasons. With refurbishments underway  stage performances yet to be curated and Diwali season round the corner  Pune residents will not be able to enjoy a new play or new movie for some time. “Theatres had been closed for over eight months. Although we welcome the unlock decision… our theatre hall is currently under renovation and we are expecting to be ready by mid-December. We need to prepare the premises in adherence to safety regulations ” said Harshad Rajpathak  theatre manager of Jyotsna Bhole Sabhagruha in Shukrawar Peth. Rajpathak said theatre halls Jyotsna Bhole Sabhagruha and Sudarshan Rangmanch  under the Maharashtra Cultural Centre  have decided that theatre groups can perform free of cost provided there is no ticket charge for the audience. “While the doors of our theatre are open  we have decided to take inquiries from theatre and performance groups only after December 1. We are still holding back as Diwali is around the corner and people will be celebrating… and there can be a possible surge in cases…. ” said Shubhangi Damle  joint secretary at Sudarshan Rangmanch in Shaniwar Peth. Popular performance venues Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hall in Camp and Bharat Ratna Pandit Bhimsen Joshi Kalamandir in Aundh  on the other hand  have decided to stay closed until there is a vaccine against coronavirus. “We are utilising the time to work on the hall space and prepare it according to the SOPs ” said Vikas Thanwal  theatre manager at Bhimsen Joshi Kalamandir. For Dramalay School of Acting and Theatre Performance  the prospective reopening period has shifted to the month of January. “Considering the well- being of all our theatre participants  we shall not be opening until next year. However  we will be organising our very first online Karandak competition for local theatre groups in December  where the audience can view and vote for their favourite under the oeople’s choice category  from the safety of their homes ” said Vikrant Mahalle  director at Dramalay. Abhijeet Choudhary  director of Swatantra Theatre  said they are still apprehensive about bookings and shows. He further explained that due to the months-long lockdown  a lot of preparations were needed before reopning. “Although the decision is an optimistic one in such times  drama groups and companies need adequate time before they can put on a new show for the audience. Additionally  much backstage work is involved in each show  so even if we begin  we will need time for rehearsals and preparation of the set ” he said. For multiplexes like E-Square and City Pride  lack of new films as well as inadequate preparatory time will delay reopening. “We are yet to prepare cinema halls and work on sanitation… firstly  we will have to gather our team… then  lack of content might compel us to screen old releases as has been happening in other states ” said Prakash Chaphalkar  secretary of the Multiplex Association of India and owner of City Pride Multiplexes. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

117,The Pimpri-Chinchwad Police Commissionerate  which is operating from a rented site and searching for a place of its own  has received a rejection slip from the Pimpri-Chinchwad Newtownship Development Authority (PCNTDA)  known as Pradhikaran  from which it had sought 10-acre land. “The police commissionerate had sought 10-acre land of the over 40-acre land at Wakad. We have told them that we can’t allot the land to the police commissionerate as it is reserved for public amenities and housing plan ” PCNTDA CEO Bansi Gawli told The Indian Express on Friday. However  in a letter to PCNTDA  PCMC corporator Seema Savale has alleged that since the Authority was trying to “pass on the prime piece of land to a builder”  it has rejected the proposal from the police commissionerate. “The land at Wakad measures 40 to 50 acres. Its market worth is Rs 800 crore. One builder has sought the land with 4 FSI. At one of its meeting  Pradhikaran has debated giving 2.5 FSI to the builder  which means the land will be worth more than Rs 2 000 crore ” alleged Savale  adding that the builder is being given the plot on PPP (public private partnership) basis. Savale said the concerned plot of land was notified in 1972. “… For nearly 50 years  Pradhikaran has not done anything on the land… now  it is trying to sell off the land for commercial purposes ” she said. Gawli  however  said he has no knowledge of any deal being struck with any builder. “…we don’t have the power to sell the land in our possession. It is done through auction and after directions from the state government ” he said. Savale alleged that negotiations for passing on the prime plot — located from Kalewadi Phata to Kaspate Vasti — to the builder have been underway since 2018. “Several meetings have been held between government officials and Pradhikaran officials. At one such meeting of Pradhikaran  this issue was debated by the members ” she alleged. Pimpri-Chinchwad Police Commissioner Krishna Prakash told The Indian Express ”We had approached Pradhikaran for alloting the Wakad land to us  for setting up our own commissionerate. We had also held a meeting with Pradhikaran officials. They had told us that the plot is reserved for public purposes but we are yet to hear from them officially… that they have rejected our proposal…”. “We need our own building for… planning and effective functioning. Also  many of our officers stay in rented flats. If we get the land  we will be able to set up our own commissionerate and staff quarters for our senior officers ” he said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

122,Doctors at National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO) have treated a rare eye disorder called Coats’ disease  diagnosed in a three-year-old boy from Pune. The boy’s parents observed a squint and a yellow glow that seemed like an abnormal reflection from his eye. The couple consulted several ophthalmologists and found out that their son had diminished vision. Doctors at National Institute of Ophthalmology (NIO) diagnosed him with Coats’ disease  which has an incidence of one in a lakh. The disease involves abnormal development of blood vessels in the retina  in which retinal capillaries break open and leak fluid causing partial or complete detachment of the retina  leading to decreased vision or blindness in the affected eye. Dr Aditya Kelkar  director of NIO  said there were different stages of the disease where the patient’s eye could eventually shrink and lead to vision loss. “The child was brought to us three months ago ” Dr Kelkar said  adding that in early stages  abnormal blood vessels are detected and  at later stages  risk of retinal detachment grows as fluid accumulates along with increased chances of development of cataract or phthisis bulbi. The exact cause  however  was not known but early intervention might help save vision  Dr Kelkar said. He also said keeping this in mind  it was decided to operate upon the child  and with an external sclerotomy  the fluid was drained following which the retina settled. Also  the anomalous blood vessels were treated with cryopexy  he said  adding that during the post-operative period  the retina was well settled with no recurrence of retinal detachment. “With timely intervention  we could help preserve the visual potential of the affected eye from further deterioration ” he said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

124,Even as Maharashtra’s school Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad said on Friday that the state is considering reopening schools after November 23 for students of Class IX to XII  most parents are wary of the risks involved in classes that require physical presence of students during a pandemic. While the minister did specify that parent’s consent is mandatory  many parents said they preferred the online education mode to classroom lectures due to the threat of Covid-19 infection. “Given a choice  I don’t want to send my son to school this year. He is in Class IX so his board exams are next year… I think he can still catch up. While there were initial hiccups  now the rhythm of online classes has set in. Besides  I choose his safety over marks ” said Sunita Gupta  a resident of Undri. Scores of parents like Gupta  who heard Gaikwad’s announcement on Friday  said they were unwilling to take the risk. “While we understand that this is a crucial year for our children and that’s why they have decided to hold classes from Class IX to XII  but is the risk to our children lesser than that to younger children  or are their lives not as precious? Once the vaccine comes in  it’s fine… but why now? The online classroom lectures are going just fine and so are coaching classes. In fact  now we can keep a tab on them  even I am keeping myself abreast of his syllabus and progress so I don’t see the need for classroom lectures  ” said Usha Vaidya  whose son Abir studies in Class X. Another concern that parents have is the division of teaching staff between online and offline classes. “Currently  all teachers are engaged in online teaching. When they resume classroom teaching  how will they divide the manpower… because subject teachers are specialised. I think some challenge lies ahead for schools as they would have to offer both online and offline classroom lectures  because many parents will refuse to send their children to school  ” said Neelima Mukherjee  parent of a Class IX student. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

125,The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB)  which checks firecrackers for compliance with noise standard and air quality in the run-up to Diwali  is awaiting fresh directives from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) before doing so this year  as the latter has already urged a ban on firecrackers between November 7 and 20. Several states  including Karnataka and Delhi  have already issued a ban on firecrackers after the NGT notice. “An order is expected on November 9 and till then  we have postponed the annual exercise of testing the firecrackers for compliance with noise standard and air quality ” Joint Director of MPCB  V M Mothgare  told The Indian Express. Recently  state Health Minister Rajesh Tope also hinted at a possible ban on firecrackers during Diwali in a bid to prevent a second wave of Covid-19 infections. In a cabinet meeting held on Thursday  Dr Subhash Salunkhe  technical head of the Covid-19 task force in Pune Division  along with other experts  said Maharashtra had to take a stand on banning firecrackers . “Delhi  Rajasthan and some other states have already banned firecrackers this Diwali and Maharashtra should also take the same step ” said Dr Salunkhe. He added that while air quality levels are comparatively better in Maharashtra as compared to north India  still factors such as cold weather and air pollutants emitted by firecrackers can precipitate respiratory illnesses. “Pollution due to firecrackers has the potential to aggravate the severity of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic ” he added. According to MPCB  the NGT bench is expected to pass an order on November 9 about remedial action against pollution caused due to firecrackers.This is why the board has decided to defer the exercise of testing firecrackers for compliance with noise standards and air quality  said Dr Mothgare. Doctors have repeatedly warned that Covid-19 patients face breathing issues due to the infection’s impact on the lungs. Pune had reported the highest number of Covid-19 patients in the country back in September  and pollution caused by firecrackers can play havoc with those recovering from the disease  they said. “We need to take steps to ensure that this toxic smoke does not affect patients at home or in quarantine ” said a doctor  adding that residents of cooperative societies should take a conscious decision to boycott firecrackers. Pulmonologist Dr Vivek Nangia said poor air quality causes inflammation in the lungs  making people more vulnerable to respiratory ailments. “We see a rise of 15-20 per cent in cases of respiratory and cardiac ailments  both in OPD and Emergency  during this period. Associated allergic problems like headache  eye burning  sore throat and others are specially observed in children. “This is also the time when the number of cases of influenza and pneumonia are on the rise due to the change in weather conditions ” he said. Experts at System for Air Quality and Forecasting Research (SAFAR) also pointed out that low temperatures and increased air pollution lead to particulate matters remaining suspended in the air for a longer period and can make people more vulnerable to respiratory ailments. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

127,Indian cotton traders are hopeful of increased exports due to a possible downward revision in the crop’s production in the US and Pakistan. Pradeep Jain  founder and president of the Khandesh Cotton Gin/ Press Owners and Traders Development Association  has projected exports of 6.5 million bales of cotton  weighing 170 kilogramme (kg) each  for the 2020-’ 21 cotton year between October and September. Drought in the main cotton producing zones and damage to the crop due to multiple hurricanes in the US has seen its production’s figure being corrected from the 17.06 million bales in September  480 pounds each  to 17.05 million bales in October. This is a sharp fall from the 19.91 million bales that the world’s largest producer had produced last year. Crop projection in Pakistan  another significant cotton producing country  has been bad due to drought and locust attacks on the crop last year. Jain told The Indian Express that India’s cotton now enjoys price parity  which has made Indian traders look for newer and better exports. “The price of Indian cotton is now priced at Rs 40 000 per candy (355.62 kg) as compared to Rs 42 000 per candy in international markets. The price parity will help us reach newer markets ” he said. During the last cotton marketing season  India had reported exports of 4.5 million bales of cotton and the expectations of this season are 6.5 million bales. Other than the traditional markets such as Bangladesh and China  traders are also eyeing markets like Turkey  Vietnam and Indonesia for exports. A per industry estimates  between 10 and 12 lakh bales of the lint left Indian shores in October alone. Jain also brought up a correction in India’s domestic production from the earlier 40 million bales to the present 36 million bales. “Reports of pink bollworm infestation and crop damage due to rains have hinted at a lower production ” he added. At present  cotton arrival in wholesale markets continues to remain stressed and the prices have been steady. Farmer are now getting paid at the rate of Rs 5 000 – Rs 5 200 per quintal for their seed cotton at the gin gate. “Most farmers are waiting for Cotton Corporation of India’s (CCI) procurement centers to start operations in full swing. Prices will remain steady ” he said. The CCI’s operations have already started in the northern portion of the country  with the government body reporting procurement of around eight lakh bales of cotton. Last season  the CCI had created history by procuring over 10 million bales of cotton and this season  a similar procurement is expected. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

128,Although fresh unlock guidelines from the state government have given single screen theatres and multiplexes an ounce of hope towards regaining normalcy  with the go-ahead to resume services from Thursday  their path is now jolted with newer obstacles. With no new content for immediate releases available  resistance from distributors as well as the looming fear of a second wave of the pandemic  cinema owners feel that garnering the permitted 50 per cent seating occupancy will be difficult. “Unlike a grocery store that can just open its shutters and sell products  I need content to show  it has to be lined up first. Secondly  there is resistance from content providers regarding the occupancy as they will not get the full benefit of our seating capacity and hence  their terms with us will vary. Our entire administration has been disbanded. As for our service providers such as the housekeeping staff  the agreements were terminated and we will have to call them back. It is only after all these crucial steps are undertaken that we will be able to open cinemas ” said Prakash Chaphalkar  secretary of the Multiplex Association of India and owner of City Pride Multiplexes. “Not all screens will be made operational by the multiplexes. We had requested the government to give us a notice period  so that we could take preparatory steps to restart the halls ” he added. Hemant Panchamia  managing director of E-Square  pointed out that the decision is “very inappropriate” and “badly timed” with respect to the industry’s demand. “There are no releases lined in November and December. With the second wave of Covid-19  all new English releases have been postponed beyond April  so what are we going to show? Subsequently  to get into the new health norms  none of the cinemas in the country will be able to completely adjust as they are not designed that way ” he said. Highlighting that the cinema industry is subject to patrons who may not adhere to safety regulations that multiplexes and cinema halls are being asked to follow  Panchamia said that their target audience – the youngsters – may not be as disciplined to adjust to the new normal of cinematic experience. “We cannot expect the multiplex management to keep policing the patrons to follow the safety rules. Moreover  there is a chance of huddling patrons around the restrooms during intervals and simultaneous sanitation is not possible. How long can you keep your intervals without disrupting the flow of the story of the film? There are several operational issues and logistics that are to be considered ” he said. The sales at the cinemas’ canteens  the major revenue generator  is restricted under the guidelines which further delays the method by which these halls and multiplexes can gain a profitable margin after a slumber of almost eight months. While 21-year-old film buff Nitin Jadhav welcomes the move and said that it will help revive occupations of ticket checkers  security and other such staffers  city-based cinephile Pratik Sarjoshi (26) said that although he enjoyed watching films on OTT platforms  he is content with the decision. “It is called a cinematic experience for a reason. You get to have a collective experience and response of the audience around you. It adds to the viewing of the film ” he said. Single screen theatres opt for a ‘wait and watch’ approach Without any exit policy in place  staffers associated with single screen theatres said that reopening in such dire times does not deem to be profitable in any sphere and there is no scope of quitting the business. Several owners of single screen theatres in the city have decided to wait till a Covid vaccine is made available. “Single screen theatres have been running in loss since the multiplexes came into being  but the pandemic has worsened the situation. Several members of the association decided that it is not viable to be operational as the financing to execute the restrictions is too high to bear in these circumstances ” said Sadanand Mohol  president of Poona Exhibitor’s Association and owner of Vaibhav theatre in Hadapsar area. “We will not be able to endure the cost of the restrictions as well as a 50 per cent seating capacity. Even if theatre owners wish to discontinue the business  they are required to seek permission of the government  which is not in place ” said Deepak Kudale  former president of the Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India. Dilip Nikam  owner of single theatre Vijay Talkies  said that the skepticism among the audience to come back to cinema halls  disregarding the safety in viewing films on OTT platforms  adds to the woes. “It is a wait and watch situation for us as single screen theatres had been facing tremendous losses even before the pandemic. After the new rule (unlock)  people would still prefer to go to multiplexes or better  view uncensored films on OTT platforms. The cost of distributors as well as overhead expenses also leaves razor thin margins for us ” he said. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

132,With decline in new Covid-19 cases  the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has allowed YCM Hospital  which was converted to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital  to re-admit non-Covid patients. However  the civic body is also cautioning people to maintain physical distancing norms and wear masks and has intensified its drive against people found without masks in public places  since experts have not ruled out the possibility of a second wave. “We were supposed to open YCM hospital for non-Covid patients after Diwali. But as the number of Covid-19 patients has come down drastically  we have opened the hospital for non-Covid patients ” said Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar. “For starters  only 50 per cent beds will be kept for Covid-19 patients…we are admitting 50 per cent non-Covid patients. Two days ago  YCM hospital  which has a strength of 600 beds  had only 60 Covid-19 patients admitted ” Hardikar said. PCMC House leader Namdev Dhake said the opening of YCM hospital was necessary as poor patients were finding it difficult to get treatment. “There was constant demand from elected representatives to open up YCM hospital for the poor as they were flooded with requests from residents in their area ” said Dhake. Due to declining cases — from a high of 1 300 on a single day in September to 116 this Monday  many Pimpri-Chinchwad residents have been spotted out and about without masks  especially in crowded vegetable markets and commercial estabishments. Even people commuting in two-wheelers and four-wheelers and children playing in public places have been spotted without masks. “In Bhosari  I have hardly seen anybody wearing masks in the past week. I think people have become relaxed after positive cases have started coming down ” said Sachin Rangdal  a resident of Bhosari. “I think residents have started taking the situation lightly ” added Kailas Jadhav  a resident of Dapodi. Hardikar denied that the health department is going soft on those not wearing masks. “Our drive against maskless people continues. I will find out in which places action has been taken in the last few days ” he said. On complaints that civic action is concentrated only on public roads and not in the suburbs where people can be spotted freely mingling in public squares in chawls  Hardikar said he will issue necessary instructions. “Till Diwali  we will remain extra cautious as experts have not ruled out a second wave. We continue to create awareness about maintaining social distancing and wearing masks ” he said. Dr Subash Salunkhe  the state government’s technical advisor on Covid  said  “The PCMC should not lower its guard even if cases drop below 10. As of now  the numbers have fallen drastically. But this in no way means that the coronavirus has gone. The PCMC will have to constantly create awareness and communicate with the masses. A possibility of second wave during the winter cannot be ruled out. Already in many countries  it has been observed that after a lull  positive cases have started rising.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.
